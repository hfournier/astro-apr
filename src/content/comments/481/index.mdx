Great post, Kirk! Iâ€™ve been implementing lean approaches in my work and personal life for a few years now, and grocery stores often come up in my conversations and thoughts about creating smooth flow and limiting work in progress. A couple of our local chains have, for example, cottoned on to the fact that having a single feeder line served by multiple cashiers is the most optimal solution, rather than having a dedicated line per cashier. With the single feeder line, customers with fewer items are not held up by that one single client with the mountain load of shopping or third party bills to pay. The overall throughput is higher than when people hop from line to line, thinking to fast-track their payment â€“ and then getting stuck behind somebody anyway.

Personally, Iâ€™ve started loving another built-in mechanism that limits WIP: the size of trolleys and baskets. Most chains here provide at least three sizes, sometimes more, ranging from a hand-held basket to large trolleys. Before I started living my life (and our familyâ€™s!) on the principles of lean, I would often drag an overloaded basket to the cashier, usually causing me to have to put the bill on my debit card and buy additional shopping bags. Now, I take the container/token size to heart when I choose one, and that immediately sets the scope of the shopping trip for me.

Of course, Iâ€™m sure the supermarket wants me to upsize as I go along â€¦ ðŸ˜‰
