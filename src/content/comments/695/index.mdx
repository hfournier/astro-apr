I like this post. I disagree with one of the points in the analysis, perhaps it is just the way it was written. In the analysis you say “User Stories must deliver real value to actual users.”. I believe that User Stories must deliver real business value. Much of the time that value will be to actual users.

Another form of business value is paying off technical debt. I believe that the product owner should at least have an understanding of how much they are paying for the technical debt reduction. I that the debt backlog that is prioritized and owned by development.

Another example of business value that extends beyond development is perhaps installing a wiki for writing and keeping documents for the organization. (Assuming a wiki has a justifiable business proposition that the business and PO buy into). This is something that has the potential to lean the organization which translates into value by saving writing time, increasing transparency, reducing errors, etc.
