In my opinion you have to reverse the problem to come to the number of stories. If you burn down story points and you wish to see change (eg progress) regularly on your graph, you inherently need to finish about one story per day. So for a 10 day sprint, close to 10 stories. This is untied to the number of team members and gives a good target to work toward.
