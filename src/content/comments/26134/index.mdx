Hello,  
Thank you very much for these articles and for these stories.  
I have the following question:

– what’s the difference between sprint planning and product backlog refinement, since sprint planning is there to discuss the product backlog, estimate them, and split the stories.

– How much effort does backlog refinement take on teams.

– The final question is whether we do the backlog refinement in one meeting before the sprint planning or in multiple meetings during the sprint.

Thank you.
