I find it sad that people require a canon, or assume there must be one for Scrum to have validity. Maybe Mark is right, and there isn’t one. How freeing that is!

As I see it, Scrum is even less than Mark outlines here (e.g. burndown charts are unnecessary). I wrote something called Simple Scrum a couple of years back: [https://agileanarchy.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/simple-scrum/](https://agileanarchy.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/simple-scrum/) which is intended to capture the spirit, or essence of Scrum, focussing on framework and principles over dogma, and viewing Scrum as an abstract class that can be implemented in any context.

When I teach Scrum, I don’t talk about such things as planning poker, release planning, etc. as I don’t believe they are relevant to the Scrum mindset. In a two-day class I believe it is more important for people to understand the Why of Scrum. The rest will follow. But without the mindshift all the practices will likely be superficial, and will be discarded when the going gets tough.

To Mike, I think you are approaching Scrum with the mind of a project manager, and I don’t think it helps. Scrum is NOT some new form of “managing”. It is an entirely new approach to work based on the principle of self-organization. When people struggle to “scale Scrum” it is because they fail to understand that principle. Self organization does not work when consultants, coaches and managers try to take charge. I wrote about team-led scaling here: [https://agilethinking.net/blog/2008/04/09/scaling-scrum-the-alcoholic-perspective/](https://agilethinking.net/blog/2008/04/09/scaling-scrum-the-alcoholic-perspective/) I still stand by the basic principle outlined in that article: Trust and Let Go.

And, rather than looking at the “3x3x3” thing as dogma, it can be thought of in a more values-and-principles fashion as:  
Roles: Why, What and How  
Meetings: Frequent, regular and appropriate conversations for the context  
Artifacts: A way to visualize requests and work in progress

Free your thinking, and forget canon, dogma, rules and ScrumBOKs. Focus on the Scrum framework and principles. This will still be Scrum. Better, it may be effective Scrum.
