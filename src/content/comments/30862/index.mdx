Hi Mark, I read this story and have a question. I am on the product side of the house. Have been doing product management for about 20 years. My organization has put a “rule” in place – not a suggestion or recommendation or a “most situations, with exceptions” – but an actual rule that no story can exceed 5 points. While I completely agree with all the thoughts in your article about keeps stories small, if work cannot be broken down into a testable unit, breaking a story into two (just so you can say the stories don’t exceed 5 points) creates work and seems absurd to me! Now, if Dev or QA comes up with a problem with our requirements, I sometimes have to update 2, 3 or more tickets (all of which have identical requirements).

Have you seen this before? Why would anyone do this? Is there any value in literally “cloning” stories to keep them within the 5 point maximum?
