Vasco – thanks for taking the time to reply. You raise a good point. Unfortunately since Rally haven’t yet released the data and the context we have trouble drawing any strong conclusions from it. In my notes I was merely trying to report what jumped out in the Rally report.

Its possible your interpretation of the report is correct, its possible mine is. What I appreciate is that they’ve published a report at all and that report allows to draw some early conclusions.

Cheers  
Mark
