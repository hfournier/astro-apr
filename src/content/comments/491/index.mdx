People look for leaders or leadership, I agree. But the fact that they are looking for something doesn’t mean you should give it to them. On the contrary, I like to say that the more desperate or the more self-evident/automatically people are looking for something, the less I will give them.

Of course, it is nice to meet a thought leader now and then, because he or she can inspire you. But at the same time the opposite happens: inspiration stops. And openness stops. People assume the best thoughts or most relevant questions come from the guru’s, people who know things, because they have a certain position or reputation or background.

I agree very much with the thing Mark says: stay open to the possibility that somebody who is completely new in your organization or business, can walk in the door and sees what is happening. And asks a crucial question, or comes up with a brilliant idea. And I like to add this: stay open to the possibility that somebody who has been working in an organization for 20 years, never had or took the chance to share his experience or thoughts, just because he thought he was not entitled to, or not good enough, or because nobody asked him. There is lot of not used potential in and around organizations and communities.

So. Good ideas are everywhere. Besides from that: ‘Why do we think we have to look for good ideas?’
