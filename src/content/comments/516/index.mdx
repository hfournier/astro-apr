To some Project Managers, Scrum is neither simple nor complete. It is also perceived as non-consistent (I know because I get to talk to many Project Managers through PM Hut).

The thing is, many Project Managers want an authoritative website explaining the role of each Scrum member, how Scrum works, and how to manage a project through Scrum. Mostly all what is written on Scrum is written on blog posts by people who practice Scrum (who may or may not have the same view on Scrum).

PS: I have published an article on Scrum a couple of days ago, the 4 questions that should be asked by a ScrumMaster, I hope youâ€™ll have the chance to read it (and maybe comment on it).
