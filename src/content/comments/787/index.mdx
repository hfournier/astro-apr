People who think that the construction industry can reliably deliver on time, to budget and on spec have never had anything built for them!

It is true that as construction tends towards manufacturing, say in erecting McMansion #127 of 200 near identical houses on a new estate then then it can be expected that everything goes pretty much to plan. But that’s true in software development too—adding another web page/database/webpage circuit much like the other 100 in a web app much like the last 20 that we built can also be expected to go pretty much to plan. In both industries it’s when we build new kinds of solution using novel techniques that things go awry. Read up on the utter chaos of the new Wembley Stadium for one particularly bad example.

In Europe, and the UK in particular, the civil engineers and allied trades grew weary of spending so much time in court with clients, employers and contractors suing and counter suing each other to see who was going to end up paying for the changes, mistakes, surprises and general muddle of large, complex construction projects that they invented a whole new kind of contractual basis on which to run such endeavours: the New Engineering Contract, now on its third iteration. Unfortunately, a lot of the NEC3 materials are proprietary (and expensive), but the principles behind it are public: cooperation, collaboration, transparency, sharing risk and reward, making issues visible early and all working together to resolve them without blame, maintaining the highest focus on safety and quality. Sound familiar?
