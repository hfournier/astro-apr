Mark, I was putting up a comment (elsewhere) and realized… Andrew Fuqua!!!

For example, see Andrew’s post (after Thanksgiving) about being the “Slack” for your team?  
[https://www.andrewfuqua.com/2011/11/slack-and-managers-role-in-scrum.html](https://www.andrewfuqua.com/2011/11/slack-and-managers-role-in-scrum.html)  
That one was very inspiring! But if I didn’t know Andrew, and I didn’t have some slack time right after Thanksgiving, I might have missed that one too. ((sigh))  
Now, I just saw that he’s got a new one…another perspective on retrospectives…I gotta read that one tonight! Andrew always manages to inspire me. Significantly.

When Andrew Fuqua talks, I listen. When he writes, I read. (Reminds me…I gotta do an RSS follow on his blog…it’s like a wake-up call for my brain!)

Cheers,  
😉
