Another thought:

What I need is a way to say, ‚Äúthis minimal set of practices that work very well together. Not necessarily to the exclusion of anything else, but at least these.‚Äù To those familiar with XP it implies a certain set of inclusive practices. If you remove any of them it is no longer XP.

What I don‚Äôt like about the ‚ÄúScrum with Engineering Practices‚Äù idea, as I have commented on my own blog, is the idea that the practices are individually and collectively optional. This leads to the idea that I can have absolutely no technical discipline at all and still call what I am doing scrum (After all, we have daily meetings.) Or, that I can introduce certain practices that I like and leave out the others. The problem being that unless I have used these practices together there is a good chance that I don‚Äôt really know what I can/should get out of them.

So, I want a way to say, ‚ÄúWe do all these things, all the time. We \*do not\* merely do some of these things, some of the time.‚Äù How do I say that? In two letters or less üòÄ
