Mark,

This is a good post. I half agree, and half disagree.

The part I agree with is about comparing velocity across teams, as long as we take velocity as some measure of how productive people are. As soon as we do that, people will start gaming the system. Not only that, they’ll start to feel pressured (or even paranoid), and morale will suffer.

Where I disagree isn’t so much as to claim you’ve said something wrong, but to advocate a different approach to the question of velocity that avoids this kind of comparison and gaming, while also providing a meaningful way to define velocity across teams.

I prefer to measure story size in absolute terms, not relative terms, and tend to use “Point” (never “Story Point”) as meaning a perfect person-day, or eight person-hours of work. This approach allows meaningful cross-team calculations, such as “how much work can five teams do.” It also prevents gaming and comparisons, since a Team’s velocity is simply the number of productive person-days available for a particular team in a particular Sprint.

This measure of velocity is not coupled to a Team’s productivity. Productivity isn’t something I see much value in trying to measure. All Team’s I’ve worked with have been eager to get things done, and measuring their productivity (even if possible) wouldn’t have provided value. As soon as you try to implement any measure of productivity, you run the risk of finding it appearing in annual reviews, and of people gaming the system. I’d rather not go there!

This approach has been adopted without difficulty by a dozen or so teams with which I’ve worked. I’m aware that some ScrumMasters say that their Teams can’t do estimation with absolute units. I believe them, but I haven’t encountered that problem personally.
