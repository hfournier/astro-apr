Joerg – It is a bit short but I usually only get 60 minutes to run this session. So two 10 minutes sprints is all they get. In addition we handle the Sprint Review and Retrospective as separate activities.

FWIW in my full 2 day CSM course the exercise is only 19 minutes of work including 4 minutes of Daily Scrum. I’m constantly amazed at the amazing products I get in a short time. I’ve also noticed that when teams have more time the product doesn’t get much better.

Cheers  
Mark
