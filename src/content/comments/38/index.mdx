The UI/UX guys could never be 100% part of the project. They would come in while UI design at the Grooming Phase or Sprint Planning, create the UI and discus UX, deliver UI and just before the Sprint is ends do a check of the UI has been incorporated properly.

There could be such roles who are not 100% part of the team.

Is this approach good or a Development Team member should possess additional UI/UX skill?
