Neutrino – there are no perfect approaches. My key point technical work, mess tidy etc doesn’t got in the \*\*Product\*\* Backlog.

Many teams have found it useful to track their messes in a separate list. This is list is owned and prioritized by the Development Team. Since a Development Team in Scrum is truly self organizing they don’t wait for permission to solve their problems – they simply dedicate an approx constant amount of time, every Sprint.

From personal experience, the most effective Teams fix the messes that are related to a Story/Feature that they’re already working on in a Sprint.
