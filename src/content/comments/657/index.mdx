Great post!

My take-away from the story is the all important lesson that developers should understand the PO’s and the customer’s REAL needs, once this is achieved the rest is much easier, and there is less risk of delivering the wrong thing or at the wrong priority.

So in your story, even if the total estimation for the whole “staff should be able to review” was shorter, dev could point out a mockup solution and suggest taking other issues that are Steering-commitee related.

As in Rugby-scrum, no reason why dev should not attack the real issue with the PO, if they are up to it.
