Gil – its interesting I’ve not had your experience, I still find adding people to a project especially at rate of > 1mth, new to the company, new to the technologies and new to complex problem domain – is a real slowdown.

Perhaps in the right environment that wouldn’t be such a problem. How do I find such an environment?
