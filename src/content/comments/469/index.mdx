I’m with Christian regarding the need for getting acceptance criteria at the time of estimation. Without acceptance criteria you run the risk of hearing things like, “No, that part is a separate story, didn’t we say that during estimation?” or “Did we include that for this estimate?”

Also, I’m a bit surprised by the “who” in your table for acceptance criteria. I’ve always worked with the goal that acceptance criteria comes from the team during story grooming. Doing this helps create dialog, especially in environments where team members are used to just following specs. (Think “conversation” from Ron Jeffries three C’s)
