Each time I see people saying that working at a distance is hard it strikes me. Isn’t all the open source developed at a distance? If that really were so difficult and people saying “don’t do it” were right, then all that what is now the foundation for many, many big projects would not exist – would it? Look at any decent size open source project and you will find lots of people from different countries working very well together. And many of them don’t even speak the same language but have to communicate in a language foreign to them. I believe that its basically the skill level of the developers that makes the difference.

Very good developers perform well on their own. Less skilled people need others around in order to request their help. If you have a team of rock stars then you can let them work anywhere they want to and it will turn out well. But if you have junior or medium level people, you need much more guidance, a team room, pairing and all the other helpful tools and techniques. An experienced trainer/consultant some days of the week would be great help as well. The available tools for software development can be overwhelming at times and having a guide makes a huge difference.
