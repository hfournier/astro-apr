Another good book is \_Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great\_ ([https://www.pragprog.com/titles/dlret](https://www.pragprog.com/titles/dlret)). I found this book very helpful in that it gives you ideas on how to mix-up the agenda of a retrospective, otherwise I find they become rote and rapidly lose their value.

Something that is important to add to the agenda is a review of the previous retrospectiveâ€™s action plan and determine if the plan was met, why/why not, etc.
