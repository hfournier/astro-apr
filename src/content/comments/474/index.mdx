Alan – thanks for taking the time to comment. Remember this was just meant to be a basic outline.

Considering one product enhancement over another isn’t so much a planning problem so much as a prioritization problem. As a result I just didn’t cover it here. Use any technique you want Lean Startup, … .

Planning the time for delivery is that what I called Release Planning Part II?

Cheers  
Mark
