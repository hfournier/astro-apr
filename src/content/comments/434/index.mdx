Mark,

Great blog post. I’d recommend you add Richard Lawrence’s new flow chart on story splitting:

As to the recommended story size, in my User Story Maturity Model, I suggest teams try to get to stories that are 5 days or less first, then try to get them down to 2-3 days. More on my maturity model here:

I tend to agree with your reference to half the iteration length, especially for 1 week iterations.
