The “TDD without thinking about architecture” trope is such a straw man that I’m surprised anyone bothered with a debate. “Looking both ways without paying attention to the cars you see is not a good way to cross the street”.

TDD, red/green/REFACTOR, is a ///way/// of thinking about architecture. I fully agree with anyone who says that if you don’t think about architecture you’ll be in trouble. And if someone isn’t thinking about architecture, they’d not be doing TDD. (At all. Not “not doing TDD well”. Not doing TDD at all.)

Where TDD folks go off the rails, I believe, is not that they don’t /think/ about architecture but more that they don’t do anything about their thoughts.
