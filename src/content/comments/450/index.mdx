\> If had phrased it better I would still use the number of days, but add that its not a story anymore its a task.

:-/ You did say that, and that is exactly what I contest. Making a story into a smaller story is utterly different to breaking a story down into tasks. I think you add ambiguity by discussing person-days, and lose the what/how distinction that is so vital.

When I work with teams, after explaining the nature of a story, I offer a guide of 5-10 stories per sprint. This makes it very clear that stories need to be small, and says nothing about how many developers will work on them, which is essentially unknown at the time of commitment and will emerge as the work gets done.
