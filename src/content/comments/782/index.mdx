Thank you for this really good article. Also mentioning the things that normally aren’t mentioned (like interruptions) and how to handle them is really useful.  
Can you just tell me which software you used for the screenshots in the article? Looks really nice and seems to have everything we need currently. We did already an extensive gathering of Kanban-tools, but didn’t see the one from the screenshots.  
Just a comment regarding the “keep it on a real wall”: unfortunately this is not possible for us, as we are split in multiple rooms. Also reporting isn’t possible that easily having just cards on the wall.
