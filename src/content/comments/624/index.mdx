I recommend Cátia Oliveira, a Portuguese Scrum Master and Agile Coach, now working at Berlin.  
Besides writing about her own experience and people surrounding her, their practices and work environments, she provides some tips and quite interesting insights of her own.

Plus, she does it with a “twisted” funny unique sense of humor and I especially love the way she makes use of irony to highlight important stuff.

Give it a try!
