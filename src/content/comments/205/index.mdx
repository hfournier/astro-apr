Clearly we differ on the value of Michael’s book. Even if you didn’t find the techniques useful for your needs, did it at least challenge your thinking?

Yes alot of these books are older than 2007 – however all the title promises is that these are in my opinion the most interesting Agile related books that I’m currently aware of.
