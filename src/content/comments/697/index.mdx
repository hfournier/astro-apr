The problem with refactoring/debt stories is that that the business value we see is generally about increasing velocity sometime in the future. It’s very hard, even impossible to really know how much and when that will happen. This value proposition is very hard to compare for the PO compared to business facing stories. I think that’s really the basic reason we are having such trouble with the technical stories.
