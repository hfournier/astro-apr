Madman (hopefully not a real name) – I’ve seen the problem in a variety of situations Scrum and otherwise. Recently I’ve seen several examples where it was understood by team members and management that Scrum meant overtime to meet the Sprint Goal or commitment. In one case the amount of extra time is causing burnout and having an effect on people’s family lives.

I wrote this piece to illustrate the problem overtime breeds. I wrote in the language of Scrum as you call it because that is the world that I tend to work in. However you’re right if you unpack it – its about miscommunication and not understanding the limits of people.

As to the language of Scrum alienating management – that depends on the managers in question and who they wanted to be in the first place. Part of the benefit of Scrum is that it provides clear boundaries about who owns which aspect of the work. In this case the problem happened when the boundaries were violated.
