I think I agree with more or less everything here.

An exception: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with using i/j/k as loop index variables. I agree that if it’s a simple loop it should be a foreach, but if you need the index for some reason then i is the best possible name for it. Unless the author is particularly perverse, I know as soon as I see it that i is the loop index – it’s one of the most powerful conventions going.

An observation: Objective C attempts to solve the object.doStuff(realParam, true, false) problem by naming the parameters in the call as well as the definition.  
As I understand it (I don’t actually program in Objective C) that call might look like \[object doStuff:realparam useWidget:true bePersistant:false\] . It looks a bit alien at first when you’re used only to function(arguments) syntax inherited from C, but I think I could get used to it.
