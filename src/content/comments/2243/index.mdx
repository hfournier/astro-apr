Hello, this is a great article with useful content from the many that I have come across. I would like to receive info on whether a production build should be held or pulled back to an earlier release while the bugs are being fixed, or do we leave at the current promoted build and fix the bugs at the same time. Then do we route in the fixed production for validation in the lower environments which are at a higher build?
