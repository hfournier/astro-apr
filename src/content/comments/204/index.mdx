Working Effectively with Legacy Code: The author makes suggestions that, while they make his life easier, make the code worse. We shouldn’t use sealed classes because instead of writing a proper unit test, he wants to extend and play with the internals of things. We should change private methods to public because no one else is using our code, and we want to test it (its not like we should instead test the public contract, therefore testing the private!). It goes on and on, with suggestions that make a consultant’s life easier and a developer’s a nightmare. Thanks Micheal!

While your list is full of old books (not quite 2007 material) – I definately think Refactoring to Patterns was great and deserves to be read. Its one of the few good design patterns books that have come out (GoF, POSA, PoEA, and EIP are the others).

Also, I would highly recommend reading books by real developers, not consultants.
