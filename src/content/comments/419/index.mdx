We split our stories as small as possible, always striving for a one or two, but I’ve found that it can wind up killing a bit of strategy – let me give you a good example. I produce an agile Webinar series every two weeks. I break the stories into the pieces of shippable content (in this case, individual web pages and emails that go live).

I manage my priorities by focusing only on what is next on my tasks or stories for the iteration. In doing that, the emails, which are very similar, can be separated by a few pieces of work. When I get back to the webinar work, I’m almost starting from scratch, when in reality, it is similar work. A larger story, with all similar pieces, would actually wind up saving time.

It is a constant debate on our team, probably one based on personal preference.
