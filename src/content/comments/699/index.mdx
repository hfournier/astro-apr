Mark – sorry to open an old conversation but is pertinent to a conversation in my team at the moment.

Once you’ve made some allowance for tech stories how do you then generally balance the throughput of these vs business stories? i.e. that the ‘tax’ is roughly at the agreed level. Do you size these stories or manage through conversation and collaboration? (Or something else)

Obviously this is more likely to present a challenge when velocity is less than forecast or the team are faster but one or other seems to be getting a raw deal.
