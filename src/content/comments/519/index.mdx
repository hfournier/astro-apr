Hardy – These PM’s maybe in for a surprise – control was an illusion and all the planning in the world won’t allow you to plan for what really happens in a project.

Aside from User Stories which are useful, but not required we largely agree on your list. Instead of User Stories think focus on building small vertical slices of an application. User Stories are just one example of that.

What I like about the rest of your list is it focuses on principles out of which the practices follow.

Well played.
