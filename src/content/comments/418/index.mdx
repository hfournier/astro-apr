Mark,

Nice article. The point about slicing vertically is especially helpful. The difficulties I have encountered so far are breaking down technical features in the back end. It could be a service or integration engine. There is no person user for this feature or at least they are several layers removed. How would you word such a story and slicing that down into a few man day sizes from man month sizes?
