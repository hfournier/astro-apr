We donâ€™t seem to disagree, we are simply talking about different things here. ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™m talking about starting to do a daily without proper agile values. Or having a physical scrum board on the wall. Simple tools and small practices before going all in with proper agile values.

Any software for running a scrum process always limits the process improvement. Unfortunately distributed teams canâ€™t work without any digital tools, but I would never recommend starting with any kind of digital tool. Physical tools are much better for learning and improving.
