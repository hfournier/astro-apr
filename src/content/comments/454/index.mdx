Santosh – thanks for your reply. I agreed with your comment right up until the end. That last case isn’t an appropriate use of Story Splitting. This is an attempt to go back and change history. The team committed to a number of stories. If they don’t complete that work, that’s fine but they don’t get to take credit for partially completed work. If anything that rewards over committing. Instead their velocity should just go up in the next sprint when they complete the work they committed to in the previous sprint. By continuing the current approach you just give the team a crutch and hide the real problem.
