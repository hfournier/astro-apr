I think I have to join Sebastien Arbogast in disagreeing.  
We are using Jira for both backlog and task list. Even though Jira isnâ€™t made for Scrum we have managed to use it quite successfully so far.  
we have been using scrum as a method for nearly 8 months now, without a status board, and have just resently created a digital scrum status screen that shows us the status for each individual task within a story.

As the part where you have to log in to make changes, that is not quite true. This beeing an internal tool, we do not have to restrict access to the status board. (the sales department is unaware of the existence of this tool ðŸ™‚ )

The use of wiimote either to track a IR pen or to point on the screen from a distance can also help us change the status of issues onscreen.  
Jira has a webservice we can access from our status screen backend, making updates nothing more than a few hours of work to implement.

Everything is possible, we just have to figure out what is right for us and do it.

As for the no screen is big enough part: How much information do you need at any given time. A short issue summary can fit onto the screen for all issues, with a mouseover/click to show the entire issue status.

The scrum status display is not a replacement of daily scrum meetings, it is an addition. It also helps remote developser to be a part of the team by joining the daily meetings by either phone or webcam.
