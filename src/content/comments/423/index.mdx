@Mark – excellent article! I can vouch from real-world experience that all of your ideas work!

@John wrote: “Worrying about splitting stories to fit into arbitrary iterations is wasteful. … This is why Kanban with XP practices is growing as an alternative to Scrum.”

There may be many good reasons why “Kanban with XP practices” is gaining momentum over Scrum. However, the idea that splitting stories is wasteful isn’t one of them. Kanban works best when all stories of are of similar size. This concept falls apart when you have some very large stories mixed with mostly small, more manageable stories.

You absolutely have to pare down those larger stories into more manageable chunks, if for no other reason than to get a good rhythm going as you knock off your queue of Kanban stories. One basic reason for this is that with Kanban, story size is ignored – each story is assumed to be of similar size. The focus then turns to the elapsed time between the start and end of the story – and getting it done asap before moving on to the next story. This is what gives you your Cumulative Flow Diagram. You just can’t do that as effectively with stories that are “too large” to get done in a couple days or a couple weeks. Fluctuations end up depending on the mix of large and small stories – which might be misleading. You can separate stories into different streams, to produce CFDs with different “levels of service”, but just because the team is too lazy to split the stories into better, smaller units is insufficient reason to say that they’re different “levels of service”.

As Mark mentioned, the idea of small story sizes comes from XP – not from Scrum or Kanban. It’s just as important to have small stories in a Kanban/XP framework as it is in a Scrum/XP framework. Small stories give the team a self-satisfying pace/rhythm, whereas stories that are too large are a pain in the ass.

With Scrum OR with Kanban, the time it takes to right-size each story is well worth it – the time spent is more than gained later by avoiding the issues that you almost always encounter with stories that are “too big”.
