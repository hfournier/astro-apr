oooh, oooh, I can probably think of 100 ppl just on my own. But it is late as I write this, so let me start with just two. Lanette Creamer, [https://testyredhead.com](https://testyredhead.com), is out there on the leading edge of agile testing. Lanette embraces the geeky side of testing, teaching herself Python to see how it would help her do more. She is also an expert exploratory tester, who knows how to pass this skill on to others (a feat I cannot seem to do). She’s a true agilista, helping her teams continually improve, looking for ways to continually improve herself. Her presentations at various agile and testing conferences are helping agile practitioners find new ways to “bake quality in”.

Marlena Compton’s academic research got her invited to important places, such as MS and Google, to present her research results. I don’t know if Marlena primarily identifies herself as “agile”, though she values the Agile Manifesto highly (see [https://marlenacompton.com](https://marlenacompton.com)). Marlena breaks new ground in testing, and builds community while doing that. She was featured in the 2010 “Women in Agile” project sponsored by the Agile Alliance.

I’ve learned so much from these two women. But, as I say, there are many more “lesser known” agilistas influencing me, I will probably suggest more to you! This is such a cool idea BTW!
