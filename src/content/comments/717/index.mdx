Sorry Pete its a problem with my tables. About 5 minutes of reading about making tables look readable on an IPad ([https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/)) and my brain hurt from all the CSS I was reading. I would happily email you a PDF of the original item as written in Word if that would help.

Sorry Mark
