I’ve been using agile now for a couple years and it seems to me that those who are advocating absolute time estimation vs relative time estimation are missing an important point. Agile projects are divided into sprints which are meant to be a particular set amount of time which your team works well within. We use 3 weeks, which is probably a bit odd, but usually its 2 weeks or a month. When you have an idea of your velocity, you know how many stories you can put into a sprint, on average. My team’s velocity happens to be about 40. So, when the entire project has been estimated, we can get an absolute release date from our relative estimations by simply dividing the total story points by 40 to know the number of 3 week sprints we should need. If there’s a particular release date that is required, we can divide the time between into 3 week sprints to determine the maximum story points we could accomplish and reduce the feature set accordingly.
