Samad â€“ rather than take my word for it head over to Less.works and checkout the case studies. Even better find a LeSS Trainer and get them to invite you to a client that does something like this.

From personal knowledge I know that parts of Microsoft have moved this way, Google and Facebook have never had special people to coordinate.

So it does happen, its easier if you build it from the ground up, it is possible to evolve an organization although hard. Read the rest of my series its basically the toolset I and others use to achieve this.

Cheers
