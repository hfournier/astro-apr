@Kevin and Tom,  
Could I ask a clarifying question?  
What is the makeup of your typical agile team? Do you mix developers and testers together, or do your team members perform any and all roles in the sprint.  
What velocity would you give a team with 4 developers for a 2-week sprint? What velocity would you give a team of 4 developers, 3 testers and 1 technical writer for the same two weeks?
