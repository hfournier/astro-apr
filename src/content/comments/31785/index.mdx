James – I’m sorry we will have to disagree. Scrum is designed to give the team space to deliver value. That space is Sprint. In addition the org should never dictate how the team do the work or the volume of work they will deliver.

I appreciate you disagree with that, so I observe something different – Don’t Inflict Scrum or Kanban on Teams: [https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/dont-inflict-scrum-or-kanban-on-teams.html](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/dont-inflict-scrum-or-kanban-on-teams.html)

You shouldn’t be forced to do Scrum (or Kanban). Work in any way that you see fit that helps your organization achieve its goals.
