We use a pretty aggressive measure – one-day stories.

If the team can’t get the story done in a day, it’s too big. Then we ask why they can’t get it done in a day. The answer(s) are the impediment list. Knowing the impediments to a one-day story lets us either resolve the impediments and reduce the “cloudy” nature of the original story into more of a “box of one-day size” that we can then get moving on. Or – it identifies that some part of the original story can be split out to its own story (not really a dependency of the original).

After we start development, if the story isn’t done (meaning: TDD completed, all tests passing, code reviewed and approved) in a day, then we need a post-mortem on why actual didn’t match expected.
