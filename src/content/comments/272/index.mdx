Nice list of articles. Thank you.

I need a case study that shows how micro-processor hardware design has been successful using Scrum. We are embarking on blazing that trail but would love to see someone else’s trail to help us.

At the least a case study of how the Scrum software team interacted as agile as possible with hardware designers. Even that would be great.

The documents from Nancy Van such as the “Embedded Agile: A Case Study In Numbers” paper you cite are VERY good. But, they focus on the agile practices of a software only team, not the hardware designers or hardware-software designer interaction.

If someone has something to share along these lines, please speak up!
