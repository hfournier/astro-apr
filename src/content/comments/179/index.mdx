I have encountered many objections to TDD in the blogosphere. Few admit that TDD is “too hard” (after all, there is one’s ego to protect), but many admit that TDD introduces a significant overhead that they are unwilling/hesitant to adopt. It is hard to know whether all of those that are wary of implementing TDD would also be weary of implementing some degree of Unit Testing, be it test-first, test-last, etc., because most pro-TDD articles do not focus on the value of Unit Testing only.

Personally, I do see value in Test-First design  
([https://blog.troyd.net/Test%2bSupported%2bDevelopment%2bTSD%2bIs%2bNot%2bTest%2bDriven%2bDevelopment%2bTDD.aspx](https://blog.troyd.net/Test%2bSupported%2bDevelopment%2bTSD%2bIs%2bNot%2bTest%2bDriven%2bDevelopment%2bTDD.aspx)), but I think many potential unit testers may be throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
