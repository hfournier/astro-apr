Thanks to Jeremy, Gerry and Eric for some great comments.

In reply to Eric’s question on chat integrated into the IDE. I would do whatever my team wants. If they ask for it, I will find a way to provide it. However from a personal point of view I’m not sure what benefit it would provide – I’ve not even found the benefit in Eclipse’s new task tab. So I wouldn’t be inclined to take away precious IDE pixels from my code.

My group chat client resides on my second monitor with my email and browser.

Cheers  
Mark
