Was listening to the Agile Revolution podcast on my commute home this evening and they gave you a shout out. So, Renee, Craig and Tony are my first recommendations. It’s a fun and informative podcast full of relevant information.

Second I’d like to recommend Benjamin Mitchell. He does a lot in the Lean Kanban community speaking about his experiences, Double Loop learning and how to approach difficult conversations. He also contributes to the ITKanban podcast.

Finally I’d like to recommend Clarke Ching, a kiwi in Scotland. He’s been the chair of Agile Scotland for a number of years and as such has contributed a lot to the growth of Lean, Agile and Theory of Constraints in Scotland. He has also written 2 great Agile business novels, Rocks into Gold and Rolling Rocks Downhill, neither of which actually mention Agile.
