just thinking….

Four other tools / tricks to add to your list:

\* Mimio ([https://www.mimio.com](https://www.mimio.com)). It’s basically a $500-$1000 gadget you attach to any existing whiteboard. It tracks the whiteboard markers in real-time, drawing on the whiteboard on your screen. Use this in combination with VNC or Webex and you can “broadcast” your whiteboarding session to anyone you want. It’s uni-directional, but better than nothing. I suggest finding one on eBay. The old serial ones (work just as well as the new USB ones, and are alot cheaper used.

\* Digital camera. Snap pictures of whiteboard doodles, upload them to your wiki or email them to other folks remotely. Nobody likes taking down the notes, and this lets you cheat. Great poor-man’s alternative to mimio, or good if you forgot to turn on the mimio.

\* Digital voice recorders. Use this instead of or addition to below. Record your meetings, and agree an audio marker/annotation format, so that you can share the voice notes with folks via mp3 and quickly zoom to a given recording section that you care about (“…. the argument over JDK versions half-way through the meeting…”)

\* Hire/use a minutes-taker. Great for formal meetings and will save you LOADS of time, confusion and debate down the road.
