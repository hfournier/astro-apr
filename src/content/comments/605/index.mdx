I nominate Alexis Hui, who has been my comrade in arms in several large scale IT transformations involving Kanban and Agile. He has played a pivotal role in changing the working culture of several IT departments of several 100s. He is also spreading agile across Deloitte, the firm we work for.

He writes with me at agileconsulting.blogspot.com.
