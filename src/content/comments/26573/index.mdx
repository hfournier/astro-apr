Foaud – sorry that I’ve been a bit behind in answering comments here. I think the key issue here is that you summary of Sprint Planning: “is there to discuss the product backlog, estimate them, and split the stories” isn’t one I would agree with. That is a rough outline of Backlog Refinement. Sprint Planning has three purposes – agree on Sprint Goal; select the Product Backlog Items for the Sprint and decide how achieve those PBIs.

When Backlog Refinement is done during Sprint Planning, the team tend to rush through the refinement portion. When they attempt to select PBIs they bog down because they’ve not had enough time to understand.

My frequent quip is that the leading cause of crappy Sprint Planning is not enough time in Backlog Refinement. As to the amount of time it takes? Simple spend enough time with the Team and PO that the top 10-15 PBIs are always well understood.
