What I would be more interested in is how to correct poor performing behavior. Rather than just identifying poor performance (that’s easy) how does a team help the poor performer become a productive team member?  
It’s easy to identify a problem but if you don’t have any suggestions on how to fix the problem, the identification is useless.
