It wasn’t your approach I was disagreeing with Mark, tracking the tasks in a separate list and paying the ‘technical debt’ tax each sprint seems like a sound policy. It was the linked Ron Jeffries article I disagreed with in which he proposes not tracking technical tasks at all. In that I think your approach and Ron Jeffries’ are fundamentally different.
