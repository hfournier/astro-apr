I am also using EasyMock (the 1.5 enabled version) with great pleasure. Usually I write my tests small enough, so its hard to get confused by the setup, run and verify states (“modes” as you call them) – stateful programming is not a new concept and should be familiar to most whether they like it or not 😉

It sounds like I should give JMock a try again though, I didn’t try it since the 1.4 version and I had the same annoyances like you with the limited set of operations available. (and the string references to methods ofcause, but that was common those days).

Cheers,  
Soren
