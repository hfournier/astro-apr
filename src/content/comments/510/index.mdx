Markâ€¦ I would suggest that the canon of Scrum is Ken and Jeffâ€™ Scrum guide. Several have written things that augment Scrum, thatâ€™s fineâ€¦ thatâ€™s not the kind of stuff that I would expect to be in a body of knowledge. As you mentionâ€¦ that stuff is not required to do Scrum.

You asserted that we all agree on the three roles, the three artifacts, and the three ceremonies. At the Scrum team level yes (5-9 people)â€¦ I would agree, but still reserve the right to bend or change even these. The problem with Scrum is not at the team level. Itâ€™s at the enterprise.

The three roles, three artifacts, and three ceremonies are woefully insufficient to do agile at scale. The Scrum answer to scaling? A scrum of scrums? That is not sufficient either.

We say that Scrum scalesâ€¦ but my opinion is that it only scales in very specific types of organizationsâ€¦ ones that organized in a way to support the rules of Scrum. Most organizations are not organized this way. In most organizations the value stream goes far beyond the single scrum team.

Significant transformation is requiredâ€¦ not just at the team levelâ€¦ at the org structure levelâ€¦ for the PMOâ€¦ for senior leadershipâ€¦ for the strategy groupâ€¦ for marketingâ€¦ for salesâ€¦ for HRâ€¦ not to mention the individuals on the team that donâ€™t currently have the skills or desire to become specializing generalists.

Hereâ€™s the challengeâ€¦ we say that Scrum scales, but most people but arenâ€™t fully aware the level of change that will have to take place across the organization to make it sustainable. They try Scrum and it fails, and they blame Scrum. Itâ€™s not Scrumâ€™s faultâ€¦ but in our zeal to evangelize Scrumâ€¦ I think we have generally overstated itâ€™s applicability.

A two day course, while valuable, does not prepare you for this. Not yours, not mine.

What I would like to see added to the canon of Scrum is context and domain applicability. Are we talking about a Scrum team in a large enterprise, or an organization that is going for end to end agility? I think it is irresponsible to say that Scrum scales without establishing context. I think it is irresponsible to say that Scrum scales without giving guidance on the kinds of additional information you might need to really make it work.

I guarantee youâ€™ll need more than three roles, three artifacts, and three ceremonies. That was the point of my tweet that you commented on ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for the post. See you in Salt Lake?
