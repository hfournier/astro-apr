Curtis – for some reason this comment missed my inbox. Sorry. I’m very uncomfortable with hard and fast rules. Clearly I prefer small stories that still deliver value. However playing artificial games to play inside a rule seems the opposite of Agility. If the problem happens rarely I would just deal with a larger story. If it happens frequently then I think the PO and Team need to work on Story Slicing and Defining Value as a skill. (In case it isn’t clear – cloning stories seems to madness, as is Dev and Test stories).

FWIW if the team is really struggling dig into Ensemble/Mob Programming: [https://agilepainrelief.com/glossary/mob-programming](https://agilepainrelief.com/glossary/mob-programming) to get the whole team focused on value.
