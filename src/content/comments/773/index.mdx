Roni â€“ yes its important to check more than just expert opinion. When you study cognitive biases you realize expert opinion alone leads to more mistakes. In Estimation the Planning Poker approach is an attempt to make sure all opinions are sampled.

For more depth consider: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wisdom\_of\_Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds)

The author of the book has shown in many cases a crowd will make better decisions than the experts.

That is one of many reasons in the Agile world we try to place most (if not all) decisions in the hands of the team.

A PMO would better off understanding the results of team level experiments and sharing them with the rest of the organization than controlling the teams ability to experiment.
