Christian – My use of Consensus comes from J. Elsie Keith’s book: “Where The Action Is”. I just cross checked “The Facilitators Guide to Participatory Decision Making 2nd” – Same Kaner et al. he uses consensus in a similar way to Keith. Neither author mentions “consent”. From my viewpoint if I changed the name to consent, I’m moving away from the common language of the facilitator community.

Thanks for making me think again.
