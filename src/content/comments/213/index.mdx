I recently left an agile/Scrum team I was on for two-and-one-half years where I was the ‘remote guy.’ I completely agree that the best you can hope for is mitigation because it is hard to work as quickly and efficiently as agile processes allow when some of your resources aren’t around. That being said, the team was very successful and I believe that was due to a few simple strategies (success == consistent delivery of what we said we would do, when we said we would be done, all without compromising quality):

1\. If you are remote then it is your burden to make the rest of the team not notice. Simple things like picking up the phone and talking to team members on a daily basis, and not just in the daily standup, worked great for me and the team. Being on both sides of the situation, nothing is more frustrating than not being able to get in touch with the ‘remote guy.’ The worst thing you can do is go dark when you are remote.

2\. Keep the team small. Our project had three developers, a Scrum Master and a Product Owner making communication much simpler. This wasn’t necessarily by design but in hindsight, and compared to larger teams with more remote employees, this was a contributor to our success.

3\. Travel on a regular basis. We worked with four-week sprints for awhile and I would travel once a month to be at planning sessions in person. When we decided to go with two-week sprints we would do as much planning as made sense and made adjustments over the phone if I was not there for the next iteration.
