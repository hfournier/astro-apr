Thao – interesting. I think all the options can make sense in different circumstances:

*   Roll back to a previous known good version – advantage immediately mitigates the problem; you can sleep tonight and not stress
*   Keep the current version in production – advantage people don’t lose access to new features

My leaning, keep deployments small – once a day (or more frequent), at most once a Sprint. Then rollbacks are lower cost, because less is being taken out of production. This also has the advantage that each deployment is less risky. In that case I would only leave minor defects live in production.
