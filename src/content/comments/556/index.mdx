Charlie – thanks for taking the time comment. It sounds like your thinking is good, I would caution only that we have to ensure that our optimization – **stopping** access to the development team – isn’t just a team level optimization. In cases like this I start by making a small change and seeing if that has the desired effect, before making a bigger change (cutting off access to the team).
