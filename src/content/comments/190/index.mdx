I get your point but somehow I don’t really agree. Because there is one component that seems very important to me in Agile Methodologies and that too many people forget about: constant feedback. Whiteboards are fine to track what is going on, but they are not enough to track what happened in the past and what should be done about it. It’s not just the management, it’s the Scrum Master himself who needs “pretty reports and charts” to make process adjustments. Think of the burn-down chart, velocity values, or even advanced metrics like evidence-based scheduling ([https://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/LearnMore.html?section=PredictShipDates](https://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/LearnMore.html?section=PredictShipDates)): if you have to do all of this manually, then you’re adding another impediment to the task of the Scrum Master. And electronic tools can do that for you.

Now of course it’s all a matter of balance and trade-off, as always. But I think that the more natural tools become, the more powerful they are likely to be. Just think of what you can do by combining a projector, Mingle ([https://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence](https://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence)) and this WiiMote hack ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s5EvhHy7eQ&eurl=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s5EvhHy7eQ&eurl=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/)).
