Perhaps this goes under the “ineffective” category, but two other common  
problems I see are: 1) lack of time to work on improvements; and 2)  
“they need to change” focus,

In case #1, I see teams coming out  
of their retros with actions to improve, but then they go into their  
planning meeting and allocate every second of capacity to working on  
backlog items. They don’t allocate time explicitly to work on  
improvement items, nor do they feel they can include improvement as  
tasks for the product backlog items. The result is the same: the  
improvement initiatives stay on the shelf.

In case #2, I see  
teams often coming up with a long list of “problems” framed completely  
as originating outside their area of influence. The natural conclusion  
then is that, to solve that, the Universe around them must change.

In either case, this generates a “what’s the point?” feeling in the team, that cause them to abandon the retros.
