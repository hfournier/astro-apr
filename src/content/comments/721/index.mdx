Hi Mark,

This was really a great read. Im in process of building an Agile team using Microsofts TFS product as the product manager and I suppose the Scrum Master and this gives a good baseline. My question stems from how you are saying scrum involves fluency within the whole team and not to be formal. Is it ok to include the QA guy and the reporting analyst in our Sprints since we are part of the same team ? Also some of our developers are working on a different project but they all can provide an update to the team so we are all aware of the initiatives going on. How can we make this successful? Hope to hear from you soon.
