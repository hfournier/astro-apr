Like Kevin I use ideal days. We do this as we work in fixed price contracts (the majority of the time) and need to cost and quote the job upfront so being completely abstract with our story points just won’t work. As an aside we also use the cone of uncertainty to buffer ourselves from estimate deviations for the financials of the project as we take the risk of having to cost the job upfront.

To avoid the hang up over whether something is 1 or 2 days we play planning poker using the Fibonacci scale. This way it is easier for the team to decide whether something is 3 or 5 ideal days for example and after the conversation they will move one way or another.

When we look at the team we purely look at how many story points they can complete in a sprint. We don’t compare this across teams as I think this is dangerous, who is to say a team delivering 60 story points is any more or less productive than a team delivering 75. As has been said this will depend on the make up of the team and the work in hand.

We do however use these figures when performing release planning in conjunction with historic availability but this is only for planning and no other purpose.

Kevin I’m wondering if this is similar to what you do when you say “how much work can five teams do” If you do this however I guess the teams must all be working on the same project/product and have a similar skill set for the comparison to be true?

Cheers
