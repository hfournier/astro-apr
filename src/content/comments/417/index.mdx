John – I’m bewildered. If don’t like Scrum and prefer Kanban that’s fine. However I don’t see the linkages between Scrum and User Stories. There isn’t one, in fact User Stories come from the XP world of all strange places. Quite aside from fitting stories into an iteration there are number of principles that underlie the reasons I listed in the article. If nothing else consider the batch size problem. The larger the size of the items in the queue the longer it takes to get them all complete. You might also consider the visibility problem with a large feature. How do we really measure progress and where things stand. Honestly large features smack of the waterfall world that we’ve only just abandoned.

Confused.
