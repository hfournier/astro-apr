Well, I know a couple of project managers that do not want to lose control over the work and the people. As Scrum teams are self-organizing and cross-functional, the pm’s feel that they will not have to do anything anymore after having set up a Scrum team…  
I’m comparing Scrum with a picture frame and canvas – it defines the borders of the picture, but it let’s you complete freedom to paint an abstract, surreal, cubistic or whatever picture – but it’s important that you paint the picture.  
However, there are – from my experience – some “must have’s” of Scrum: The backlog, the sprint board, the difference between user story (what) and task (how), the rhythm, the role specifications, the self-responsible work which is not controlled from outside, the self-reflection on product and process. These are – for me – the crucial success factors that lead to a non-overspecified product, a motivated team, a continuous improvement.
