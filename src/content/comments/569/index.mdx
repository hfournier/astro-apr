Another good post Mark.

My teams have often gotten bored with retrospectives. There are a ton of options, as you mention, for varying retros and refreshing the team while getting the team to continuously improve. Boredom may be born out of retrospective complacency, but they may also be different issues.

High performing team complacency:  
I teach teams from the start, that we can always improve. They should always invest in themselves by trying new things that get them a little further. I don’t preach the best of breed notion because at some point, I do want them to feel they are the best… and I still want them to improve. A team that brings new ideas to the table even if they are killing the rest of the industry with quality and productivity is very valuable indeed.

Complacency with the value of retrospectives:  
On the other side, some teams don’t actively pursue improvements during and after the retro. They may not see the value of the retro. That needs to be coached. They need to understand the value to them and the company/product.

My “when to stop” answer? Never. I always want them to improve. Very mature teams may move to a “stop the line” mentality, but even then I still want the team to value dedicated time to reflect. My only other option would be if they came up with a new innovative way to have this continuous improvement cycle.
