These researches are all within boundaries and context. It can not be argued that currently F2F is most efficient (92% of communication is non-verbal). The question at hand is what is the gain and what is the loss when deciding to accept remote communication.

For example I have teams with one dedicated working-at-home day. Loss is certainly some communication but it wont be 92% because everybody has already an impression build-up during the other 4 days. Gain might be people not driving for 3-4 hours to and from work, giving them time to spend with family on breakfast or dinner â€¦ gain is a team member feeling better then just being a weekend parent. 9 out of 10 people working at home are more productive.

The team decides and as a Scrum Master you have the only role to make sure that the most important arguments are identified and valued properly.
