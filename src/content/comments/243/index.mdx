You might also be interested in the unit testing framework that is part of [qooxdoo](https://qooxdoo.org), an open source RIA framework similar to Dojo, ExtJS, etc. but with quite a comprehensive tool chain.

Try the online version of the [testrunner](https://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/testrunner). Hint: hit the gray arrow at the top left (should be made more obvious). It’s a “play” button that runs the selected tests.

To find out more about the JS classes that let you define your unit tests, see the online [API viewer](https://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit).

For automated UI testing (based on Selenium RC), check out the [Simulator](https://qooxdoo.org/contrib/project/simulator) project.
