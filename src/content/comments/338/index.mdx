Kevin â€“ thanks for taking the comment. Your idea is intriguing and makes velocity something you can compare across teams. But it suffers from the problem that Story Point estimation was invented to solve. Human beings it turns out are not good absolute estimators. Example: estimate the height and weight of the next 5 people you meet today. Now ask them and see how accurate you were. Likely you were not very accurate at all (there is some good science on this). When doing group estimation with Ideal Days (or even weeks) people will argue tooth and nail over the difference between 2 and 3 days. Since neither was likely right, it doesnâ€™t matter. There are a bunch more reasons â€“ but you just made me realize that I need another post on this subject. Thanks ðŸ™‚
