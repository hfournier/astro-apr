Another issue is that retrospectives that are not well facilitated tend to use all the timebox with poor results. I believe a 5 minutes retrospectives which leads to actionable and committed action items is more useful than a 2 hours one full of wishful thinking and not many actionable items and where 20% of the attendees speaking 80% of the time.  
For many times I have seen, retrospectives and coming up with action items to improve their own work is a very unnatural thing to them. So the key for me is to avoid the “not again another meeting” phenomena and really make sure it is a way to be sure the team improves. Let’s not forget that “progress” is one of the biggest motivating factors for knowledge workers (arguably even more than “purpose” for many people).  
Another point is also to make sure the retrospectives do not forget the “elephant in the room”, the large problems that do not change sprint after sprint but that really impede the teams productivity. So just a follow-up on how to improve on those big issues and have good committed action items is often better than a lengthy meeting on small issues.
