Norbert I’ve not seen the reference, perhaps you can share it with me tomorrow. You’re right under the best circumstances the slowdown can be short (although I’ve never seen it as little as 3 days). However the circumstances I normally encounter are clients with a complex problem domain, one or more new technologies and who’re new to agile. In these cases new people are highly disruptive in my experience.
