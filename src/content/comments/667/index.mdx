While I agree that the “Product Owner” (as the role is called) is not just an uber Business Analyst, to expect this person to be available whenever the dev team needs AND have a clear understanding of the business + budgetary authority, etc. is not always realistic, especially in a larger org. To be well versed in the business and customers, you need to spend time ON the business and with customers. That can easily be a full-time job. But I’ve seen many agile teams that expect the product owner to be available almost the entire time or be “on call” at all times. And budgets don’t always trickle down to execution team. While I support agile as an SDLC process, it seems to me agile teams needed someone to represent all business/customer interests, so rolled it up into one uber role called the product owner. I wonder if the flipped model is possible: that the dev folks spend more time in the market with customers and understanding the business. Spend 1 hour with a customer and it’s eye opening.
