I suggest David Hussman. He lives and works in Minneapolis, where I live and work. He runs a small consulting firm of agilists. He has been instrumental in contributing to the energy of our local agile community. [https://devjam.com/ He](https://devjam.com/ He) runs a few user groups where agilists come to eat, drink, and argue. He has cosponsored our local Code Freeze [https://www.umsec.umn.edu/events/Code-Freeze-2011](https://www.umsec.umn.edu/events/Code-Freeze-2011).  
Oh, and I see Lisa Crispin below. Well she cannot nominate herself but I would nominate her too. I read the book she co-authored on Agile Testing. It is great.
