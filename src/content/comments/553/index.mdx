Jeroen – we’re in complete agreement I wouldn’t use stock Scrum for support teams. In the story we have a development team who’s application has gone live, they need to support the application but balance that support with ongoing development work.

The Scrum/Kanban combo you describe can work well and I probably should have called it out explicitly in the post. One small point, “if you have a lot of issues” – you need to stop and understand why you have these issues, i.e. Root Cause Analysis etc.

Cheers
