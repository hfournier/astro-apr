Ben – thanks for the comment. Your comment about stimulation outside the team is an excellent one. Alot of the research reading I’m doing at the moment puts a huge emphasis on seeking new ideas and diversity of thought. I would suggest diversity beyond the business is key. If both Noika and RIM/Blackberry had seen this early disasters might have been avoided.
