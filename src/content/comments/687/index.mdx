It seems a bold and appropriate decision by Marissa Mayer to “shock the system”. Most of the articles I’ve read about the Yahoo shakeup tended to conflate the less relevant “productivity” with the more salient “culture of collaboration”. I suspect Mayer wants first want to realize the many fruits of face-to-face collaboration, and secondarily, to stem abuses. I think this move is as simple as Mayer wanting people working face to face and focusing on improving the Yahoo product offerings. Most of us have learned the hard way that it’s very difficult to grow a culture of collaboration with remotely located team members – particularly when team members haven’t already established a face-to-face working relationship.
