Yves – elegant I hadn’t remembered to combine the Unit Testing and pairing. You’re also write that some of these solutions create a dual society, which is unfortunate. However in the short term I might have to make a tactical decision about slowing down the product development or making the newcomers feel less than full members of the team. Its not a choice I like, but I want people to be aware its a choice they might have to make. Frequently the real solution is to say ‘no’: this is a high stakes project that has to ship in a few months don’t hire any new people for me.
