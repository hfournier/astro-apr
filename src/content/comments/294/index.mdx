JavaScript – ahh now that’s an interesting beast. I really don’t know it and can’t make any comment. However I wouldn’t generalize lessons learned about performance from JavaScript to any other language. I’m certain that foreach in Java and its .NET equivalent have been well thought out by their implementors and don’t add a performance hit.
