I was with you all the way up until “I don’t want recommendations visible to the proposal author. These are often friends and colleagues who I want to work with again.”

You’re a reviewer on a session that I proposed. I can see your review, though if you have a separate field for an accept/reject recommendation, I can’t see that. (And btw, I posted a comment answering a question you had in your review.)

However, I want to note that even if I \*could\* see a big old “REJECT” recommendation, it would be OK. Honest.

I am grateful to you for serving on the conference committee. It’s a hard, thankless, time-consuming job. I know; I served on the committee for 2 years.

I understand that this is an excruciatingly difficult decision process and that there are far more good submissions than there are slots. And I understand that your recommendation is not about whether or not you like me, or whether you want to work with me again. This is a decision about which sessions have the greatest probability of serving the audience for the conference. Ultimately, that’s about serving the customers: the conference delegates.

Greater transparency gives me more feedback from which to learn for next time.

So I hope the conference review system allows for even more transparency in coming years. I might not like the news, but I’d rather know.
