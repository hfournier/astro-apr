Glenn – I think you’re saying that some business value can be delivered in ways that aren’t directly tied to end users. Agreed in which case don’t use user stories for them.

If the Product Owner can make sense of the value and prioritize it great. In many cases they can’t make good prioritization decisions around these items.

If the wiki was for the benefit of the dev team I probably wouldn’t put it on the Product Backlog. If it was a greater good, I might.

What wouldn’t go there is the issue with the “Foobar class”.
