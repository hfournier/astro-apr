I approve of your modification of Ron’s origin metric – just one word of caution, though: “Purchased” often tells you little more about the value being earned by a feature than does “Tested”. Better to consider “in production” / “in use”, or even better still, take the Systems Thinking (Synergistic) perspective and consider to what extent the feature in use with a given customer actually elevates their constraint and increases the throughput of their “system”.

Cheers
