While I agree that the core of agile has very little to do with tools, it is much easier to get started with small practices and tools than directly trying to change the core values behind how an organisation operates.

In my experience transforming an organisation to agile usually starts from practices and tools. Demonstrating value for these early helps to speed up the larger and much slower transformation of values.

Indeed an organisation is not yet agile just because theyâ€™ve adopted a scattering of practises, but with the right support in place they may be already headed to the right direction.
