Mark: You make a great point that is often overlooked and can lead to inaccurate story point estimates. This is why I always use Mike Cohn’s free on-line “Planning Poker” tool (www.planningpoker.com).

Even if we’re all together in the same room, using the on-line tool on individual laptops eliminates the problem of “influence” since all cards are revealed on-line at the sametime. When using a physical deck of cards, I’ve seen team members change their card estimate after someone else shows their card (especially if this is a development lead, QA lead or subject matter expert (SME). On-line planning pokers hides the values until the last card is played, when all cards are revealed on-line simultaneously.

It’s also imperative that the entire team calculate these story points as a group when  
using planning poker. Planning poker in isolation doesn’t work. Team members  
estimate story points based on their individual understanding of a story. It’s thus possible that one team member will remember numerous testing dependencies that others didn’t understand, while others may remember that development of a related story also applies to the story being estimated, making development less work. Under this scenario, if planning poker is played with the whole team, the first round should reveal a wide disparity in story point estimates between team members. This doesn’t always happen when team members are “influenced” by each other’s estimates. Planning poker works only because of the discussions teams have around the disparity in their estimates,  
then come to understand the requirement as a group. Within several rounds the entire team agrees on the story point estimate. This can’t happen in isolation and to James’ point also requires that team members do not influence each other’s estimates until after estimate disparities are revealed. Although the discussions are necessary to come to concensous on a story, the discussions must be “timeboxed” to eliminate James’s legitimate concern about long discussions that provide less and less benefit as they continue. We need to remember that some analysis has benefit, while too much analysis is a waste of time. I recommend using the 2-minute timer on the planning poker site which limits discussions between rounds to 2 minutes. You may also need to limit the number of planning poker rounds if required. This good news is that teams do learn to estimate story points more efficiently over time. John H.
