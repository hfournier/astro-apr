Vartan – there is a lot of research around the effectiveness of face to face interaction over electronic communication. When I have a spare month I will post on the subject. In addition we have over two thousand years experience with face to face communication, it would seem to be up to the new kid on the block to prove its as effective.

I don’t demote the value of individual productivity – I just note that most products we build these days are the output of teams so our focus should be optimizing the performance of teams and not individuals.

I don’t doubt in 10 years time this will be a different question and playing field. Until then face to face wins.

Cheers  
Mark
