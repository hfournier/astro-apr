It looks like John didnot play the role of SCRUM Master really well. He should have protected the team from CEOâ€™s direct entry into Daily Standup meeting and regular feedback with PO for items.

Your suggestion about portfolio map is quite wonderful. With such information radiators, it would surely help the team to set expectations right.
