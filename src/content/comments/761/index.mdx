Vesa – we will have to disagree. When you start with an electronic tool you will do things in the way the electronic tool suggests without always giving it sufficient thought.

I’ve noticed that teams that start on simple tools (index cards, google spreadsheets, …) figure out what matters to them first. Teams that start early (first 4-5 mths) with an electronic tool wind up doing things that the tool offers (i.e. tracking task hours) that probably don’t help at all.
