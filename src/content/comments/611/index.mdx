Craig â€“ thatâ€™s an awesome list. I was surprised to realize that Rowan and Kane would on a list of voices that arenâ€™t as well known. I will have to give that some thought. You do realize my quest is almost impossible, no matter what I will miss some good people.

I know many of the others and will add them to my list.

As for the exclusive to Agile part â€“ I had to draw the line somewhere, next time out it will be voices outside the community that we should hear ðŸ™‚  
Thanks for the comment  
Cheers
