I’ve tried both JMock and EasyMock but ended up going back to EasyMock (1.2, as I’m also restricted to JDK 1.4 at the moment).

I found that in most tests there was a setup phase, then a point to set the mocks to replay, an invocation of the class under test and then a verification of the mocks. Even where I needed one mock for use in another, the replay needing to be done ‘early’ wasn’t an issue, and on the upsite, I had the advantage of the full IDE support when coding the calls to the mocks.

Note they both let you mock classes, if you need to, and both let you set varying criteria for matching calls, arguments, etc.
