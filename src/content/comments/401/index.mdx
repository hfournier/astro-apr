Mark,

In Measures For Excellence: Reliable Software On Time, Within Budget, by Lawrence H. Putnam, Ware Meyers, [https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Measures-Excellence-Reliable-Software-Time-Lawrence-H-Putnam-Ware-Meyers/9780135676943-item.html](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Measures-Excellence-Reliable-Software-Time-Lawrence-H-Putnam-Ware-Meyers/9780135676943-item.html), they show that Brookâ€™s law is not in fact correct.

My experience has been that the slowdown cost can be as short as 3 days. Other factors involved are the skill of the people coming in and their familiarity with the problem domain and the quality of the product implementation and its environment.
