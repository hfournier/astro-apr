Mark, I have the same experience about changing formats. It helps to keep teams interested to do retrospectives, and brings up new insights which help them to improve continuously.

I maintain a blog post on different kinds of retrospective, to promote using different formats: [https://www.benlinders.com/2011/getting-business-value-out-of-agile-retrospectives/](https://www.benlinders.com/2011/getting-business-value-out-of-agile-retrospectives/)
