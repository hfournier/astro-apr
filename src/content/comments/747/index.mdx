Chi – congratulations I’m sure you’re doing the best job you can under the circumstances. Please don’t take the following comments as judgement about you but about the situation you have been placed in.

One thing to check first are you really the ScrumMaster or the Agile Coach for 4 teams?

Scrum is a tool to build High Performance teams – see my paper: [https://agilepainrelief.com/high-performance-teams](https://agilepainrelief.com/high-performance-teams) on the subject. As such a ScrumMaster’s role is to help build that team.

Have you helped you team(s) double their productivity in a year and do it again in the next? If you’ve done this correctly your team should be so effective Infoq.com would delighted to receive a case study.

Have you reviewed the other articles linked to above? Can you really same that you’ve been through all the items on MJ’s ScrumMaster checklist? …

The ScrumMaster’s role has nothing at all to do with tools (although they can occasionally be helpful) it has everything to do with building high performance teams.

Good Luck Building/Coaching truly high performing teams.
