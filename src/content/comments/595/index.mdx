Thanks for the comment Ashish – obviously the team is newer to Scrum. In this case I don’t think they were ready to improve their engineering techniques. For a team that was ready I suspect that learning Test Driven Development and Acceptance Test Driven Development would have helped a great deal.

Cheers
