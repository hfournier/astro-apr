Micromanagement isn’t a scrum anti-pattern, it’s baked into scrum’s DNA. If you’re doing scrum without micromanagement then you’re not doing scrum. Trying to pretend otherwise, or just falling back on the old excuse of “you’re just not doing scrum right, otherwise everything would be perfect” isn’t fooling anybody.
