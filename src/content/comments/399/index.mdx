You coudl combine the unit testing and the pairing.

Either:  
– ping pong pairing  
\-have the new people only pairing with echother to write tests.  
(I don’t like this as it creates a dual society, but hey will learn quickly learn the project and not distribe the other people)  
\-normal pairing + making sure the tests are written.
