Samad – thanks for taking the time to comment. Your approach has been tried. Most famously at Nokia – a presentation from Ran Nyman and Ari Tikka: [https://agileprague.com/slides/ap2016/RanNyman-Taylorism-Agile.pdf](https://agileprague.com/slides/ap2016/RanNyman-Taylorism-Agile.pdf) documents alot of what went wrong. From my own conversations with them it was the overhead of the coordination eventually became to large a burden.

If you really want an approach that creates a coordination layer – consider SAFe which is designed to ensure the best alignment between doers and executives. I generally don’t recommend SAFe to my clients.

You mention Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), which I know well and Enterprise Scrum (which I have less familiarity). At their heart both start with Scrum, Scrum requires self organization and expects teams to eliminate dependancies.

LeSS requires self organization between teams, it teaches systems thinking, lean and some behavioural psychology in an attempt to help teams understand their dependancies. LeSS challenges organizations to re-shape themselves to eliminate most dependencies think Feature Teams over Component Teams as the simplest example. So instead of Intra-Team coordination becoming the domain of specialists it in fact becomes the domain of all team members so that they can be more effective (not more efficient).

I’m not picky about the titles people hold, I do need all people in a organization to help improvement otherwise we bottleneck on the capacity and skills of those people.
