A good article that shows examples for the concept of  
“Minimum Viable Product” and user story independence, and the rationale behind!

I think the following statement may need to be slightly  
rephrased though:

“When the team said that they needed to write the staff side  
of the review system before displaying any reviews they were taking prioritization over from the Product Owner.”

Instead of saying “they were taking prioritization over from  
the Product Owner”, I think it’s actually valid and healthy for the team to provide  
their inputs from development/technical perspective. Business value is of course the number one criterion for  
prioritisation, but other criteria such as technical risks, implementation  
difficulty, or relationship to other requirements are also important, and PO  
may not be fully aware of them until the team present their view based on expertise or experience. While ultimately it’s the PO’s responsibility to  
decide the priorities, it’s more of a collaborative effort than someone is  
taking over prioritization from another.
