I finally took the time to respond to this, Mark. I like your suggestions and really hope that Agile 2010 with implement them. I especially think they need to improve the flow of information during the proposal period. If they do a good job of that in 2010, then perhaps as early as 2011 we can reduce the selection process to scheduling and managing conflicts, because we will have done all the reviewing and rating leading up to the submission deadline.

I have a number of suggestions, too, but I fear that if the stage producers and submitters don’t jointly take the reins here, then nothing will change. We know how much energy one needs to produce a stage and review submissions. It exhausts us. If we truly want to change things, then we must start now.

I like Chris and Dave’s idea about providing guidance to submitters. I think we should also guide them in demanding feedback! I think that would provide a great first step. I think the submitters and reviewers both need to act as customers for the submission system. I volunteer to own a feature request. Who else does?
