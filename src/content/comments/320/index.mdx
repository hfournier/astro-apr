Good solid actionable advice Mark! I would not discount the LinkedIn groups – I know you contribute there – this is fertile ground for building a name, networking and helping people all at the same time. Over and above some of the more “respected” forums etc. LinkedIn groups are highly used and the ratio of people needing to to those that actually do is higher than with a lot of the alternatives, and hence gives more opportunity.

Many thanks  
Mick….
