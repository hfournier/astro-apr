Great article, i agree with the author that focusing on one specific tool or methodology is not a good idea because like he mentioned what works in a specific context may not work in an other. After reading this article, i realized another important benefit of incorporating a project management office (PMO) in any organization. The PMO may be composed of few people that will have the responsibility of determining what tools and methodologies work the best in each specific context.
