I never said a canon couldnâ€™t evolve ðŸ˜‰

But anywayâ€¦ I have recently come in behind two struggling Scrum implementations with clients that have been beating their heads against the wall to apply the 3x3x3 formula. Putting in some simple, non-Scrum, scaling constructs has helped them be more successful.

I donâ€™t think anyone did it on purposeâ€¦ but we somehow gave a lot of people the idea that this team based method scales out of the boxâ€¦ and now you know my opinion on that. Most Scrum folks I know are extremely dogmatic on the 3x3x3 and I think that can be harmfulâ€¦

I attended a talk by Ken at Agile 2007 that point blank made the typical 3x3x3 SoS scaling argument. I just think that is really bad adviceâ€¦ I wouldnâ€™t want to be held to things I said 5 years agoâ€¦ but at the same time, so many people hold onto the this scaling pattern, I find it very frustrating.
