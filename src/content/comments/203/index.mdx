As you say, pair programming happens in real time.

My biggest problem with static code reviews is that they happen way too late. I’ve been in code reviews where people make perceptive comments about the design, but the code is already in QA, so there’s nothing you can do about it. Even on the other end of the spectrum, where people just want aesthetic improvements to the code, there’s a reluctance to actually implement the changes.

If pair programming is not an option, then I would schedule code reviews for halfway through the implementation, even if that means the final code doesn’t get reviewed. At least then the code review could help steer some of the implementation in a meaningful way.
