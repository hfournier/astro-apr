You have explained your points well enough on RYG project status indicator and I am in agreement. The best way for management to know the reality on the ground is “Go See” approach. Reviewing Issue and Change log can give management insight of what is going on within project/portfolio environment. No one should take RYG report as an actual status of any project/portfolio. Looking at the combination of budget, schedule, resource, quality, scope, and etc. … It is always difficult for lack of a better word, to have all these indicators to sync to one direction to show it on RYG chat.
