It works in waves – you work with one groupdepartment at a time.

I have tried the one-day “This is TDD” approach and I would periodically get requests to come back. For the longest time I could not understand what was wrong and then I realized my approach was wrong. I was treating the situation like I was an external consultant, but forgot I was an internal consultant and had more flexibility on the schedule of the employees.
