Pete thanks for the comment. In terms of the role you might be right however I’m wary of the of the title. I would prefer the role to be “Architectural Coordinator” – which implies that the person isn’t solely responsible for anything. My real concern is that the Architect title allows other team members to abdicate their responsibilities.

Cheers
