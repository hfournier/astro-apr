Thank you for the overview.

I think you described “consent” when writing “consensus”. Consent can be defined as “no significant objection” where as consensus in my opinion means “agreement”.  
Sociocracy 3.0 defines a consent decision making process, which uses consent. It’s a bit complicated but when you get used to it it’s really powerful ([https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/consent-decision-making.html](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/consent-decision-making.html)).

Kind regards  
Christian
