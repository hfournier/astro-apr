I agree. Language matters. There will always be these “what’s in a name?” people who don’t mind, and don’t see why anyone else would mind. But they’re wrong. Every marketer knows the choice of name is important. There was a recent blog posting about this:

[https://blog.magenic.com/blogs/aarone/archive/2008/11/19/Pair-Programming-\_2D00\_-Marketing-FAIL.aspx](https://blog.magenic.com/blogs/aarone/archive/2008/11/19/Pair-Programming-_2D00_-Marketing-FAIL.aspx)

He recommends rebranding XP “Collaborative Programming”. I like this suggestion. I’m not sure that covers all the bases, but it’s a start. The problem is that are a lot of books and web pages are that use “XP” and “extreme” and other words that don’t sell well, and people will be suspicious of a sudden rebranding. But I think it has to be done, slowly but surely.
