Vasco – again we’re in broad agreement. I think it would be better if there were a published dataset. However I think that publishing a report in without the data was a good first step. Much of the medical literature is published without the raw data yet we accept many of their conclusions as valid.

Like you I would like the data but I don’t think they’ve done a poor job.
