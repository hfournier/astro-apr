I like the SMART goals! I also encourage teams to have a relative balance of Facts, Events, Observations and Kudos. I think many retros tends to be 100% observation based which can make it seem like everyoneâ€™s soap box moment. Events create a collective memory of what happened and help teammates remember contributing factors. Facts give the team something to concrete to benchmark, review and improve upon. Kudos create a happy, grateful environment to share and feel safe in. Rounding out all of these types of feedback creates a retrospective thats is productive, actionable and enjoyable.
