Hi,

I think TDD vs POUT is a case of chicken or egg, what’s the big difference when you write the test? Yes I heard that it’s about design and not testing(or both) but really what difference does it make if you design the old fashioned way(prototyping, etc.) or the new flashy way TDD? Cleaner code, fewer bugs, etc.? Well any code is only as good as the developer writing it, and tests can go bad too and paint you’re design in a corner if you make too many false assumptions. TDD is beautiful in theory same as Communism is but it all breaks down in practice. There are simply too many loopholes where TDD is not feasible or not cost effective and the definiton of it is all or nothing so it ends up with nothing or a bloated unmaintainable horde of test cases that prove nothing of relevance.
