we use both points and hrs. these are just two data points that give us an understanding of progress. maybe iâ€™m missing something but not sure why it was caught so late in the sprint that they were not going to get the stories completed. good discussion for the retro on what to do better during the next sprint. i would key on the daily stand-ups.
