hi!

I’m lead developer for RhinoUnit, and I’d love to know how I can improve the library for you. If you could let me know what problems you had I could look into fixing them for you.

You mention that you tried to run test code from JSUnit in it – this isn’t really how RhinoUnit works. I’ve tried to make it as javascript fluent as possible, rather than trying to mimic SUnit. Consequently I use Functions rather than objects, and I test for more JS specific things like forgetting VARs, running JSLint, ensuring that functions get called an so on.

Basically the framework developed out of real world requirements rather than just copying someone elses.
