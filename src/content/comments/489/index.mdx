@Tobias I see your comment about the usual suspects but am not sure I entirely agree. I mention them only by first name to avoid giving them lustre. Perhaps more importantly I wrote this quickly, at the end of a long week while sitting in airport on the way home. I didnâ€™t give it the deep thought it deserved. Think of this of as more a riff than a well thought out post.

Thanks for the idea about citizenship I like it.

@Yves I appreciate that people look for leaders mostly I want them keep open minds and look beyond the obvious names. I want them to be open to new ideas. As I said to Tobias consider this post to be a riff and not complete.

Maybe you and others can fill in the details.
