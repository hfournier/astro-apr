Anna – your comment is hardly too long.

You bring up a number of interesting points. I didn’t go into anymore detail in the post because it was already way too long.

Companies need to focus on hiring the right people and involving the right people in the hiring process.

On the other side when all else fails HR departments need to act quickly once its been demonstrated that a person can’t be helped to work in a given role.
