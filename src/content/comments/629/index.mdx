A colleague of mine, Cain Hopwood, blogs on agile and management at https://www.cainhopwood.com/category/agilescrum/. Weâ€™ve been using one form or another of Agile and Scrum for the last few years here so he tends to focus on issues that relate to getting Agile accepted in enterprise environments where momentum against change is a particular challenge.
