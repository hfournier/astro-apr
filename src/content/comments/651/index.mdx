Mark,  
Great post. Can you go deeper into the process of defining the #2 and #8 stories? I understand the differences and the benefits of the variance, it’s the process of picking those two stories out.

Thanks.

Stories of size ‘2’ should have few unknowns. When they pick the prototypical ‘8’ I suggest this should be a story that isn’t completely understood and still has an unknown or two.
