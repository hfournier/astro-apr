I am SM for 4 teams and being asked to handle more. And thatâ€™s only 50% of my time because the other 50% is being PgM for some other initiatives. What is the big deal with handling 3 teams? ðŸ™‚ Fluency in tools i.e. Rally, Tableau, Jiraâ€¦ + strong PO & Architects probably help determine how many teams a SM can support.
