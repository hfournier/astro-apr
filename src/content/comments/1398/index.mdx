Viashali – you’re welcome. We have more material in our reference library: [https://agilepainrelief.com/scrummaster-resources-and-references#maintenance](https://agilepainrelief.com/scrummaster-resources-and-references#maintenance) – with a caveat, in the next few months the library will evolve (its grown too large for the original container) and so links like this will break. The material will still there, but the link won’t work any more.
