As far as I know, a properly-practised Agile model invalidates, or comes close to invalidating Brooks’ Law. Pairing is top-most; have the newcomers only work in pairs. Executable documentation is another parameter. Effective self-organization is yet another. Of course, if you throw in the mix variables that challenge the existing team members — like a move to Agile or management pressure — they will have their own effects.

I coached a team a few years ago that had a new developer join six weeks before the 1.0 ship date. They were practising rigourous pairing and that new member was reasonably effective (in pair settings) within a week. He integrated almost seamlessly. I don’t think they took any productivity hit. I’d argue that in such situations, if the new person provides a continuous dose of Beginner’s Mind, that’s a Very Good Thing.
