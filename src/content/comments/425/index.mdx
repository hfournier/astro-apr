In Product Sashimi, we teach splitting feature areas (often epics) into examples (scenarios), then bundling those examples as needed into features (stories). I prefer this, because it focuses on finding the kernel of a feature idea, which we could implement first, before figuring out all the stories and worrying about how big they are.

I have found so far that people feel very uncomfortable deferring details about some important examples simply because they donâ€™t form part of the kernel of the feature area. I need to learn more about how to help them feel comfortable.
