Karl its complex – of the four books mention above Zull’s “The Art of Changing the Brain” is the most relevant to teaching. Linda found John Medina’s book “Brain Rules” more valuable – whereas I found it a bit fluffy. Finally if you’re looking for the most interesting but least applicable read Norman Doidge’s book “The Brain that Changes Itself”. Great writing and good background.

Of course you could just invite me to present in Montreal 🙂
