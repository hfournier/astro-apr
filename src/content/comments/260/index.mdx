I have made contributions to both open and closed source projects where all of my code was test-driven even if some (or all) other code was not.

I find that TDD fits my brain. I also find that the code that \*I\* produce is better/simpler/more correct with TDD (And even better/simpler/more correct with close collaboration with at least one pair programmer.)

However, it is hard to quantify how/if this improves the overall quality and design in an environment where these practices arenâ€™t strictly enforced. It is hard enough to know what percentage of the code benefits both directly and indirectly from the introduction of TDD let alone what percentage of suck-ness results directly and indirectly from where it is missing.
