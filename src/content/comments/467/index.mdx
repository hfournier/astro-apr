Christian – thanks I’ve thought about this a bit before and I’m ambivalent. Sometimes they’re discovered before Backlog Grooming and other times they’re not. I don’t general find their absence to make a big difference with estimation. It often happens that team members ask clarifying questions while doing the estimation that help discover the boundaries and so the acceptance criteria. I do expect them to be in place for Sprint Planning.

Cheers  
Mark
