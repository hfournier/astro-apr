Let me be brief. I played for 35 years and hooked for 30. Scrums are more dangerous than they need to be. With a pointed or convex pressure point they try to jam the hooker farther into the tunnel than needed.  
Disperse that pressure point across the front row and give the hooker the ability to operate freely and support himself and his props. He can be under the second row push or raise his rear bumper if he prefers to engage them.
