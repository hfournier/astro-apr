Yes, absolutely. And as part of their conclusion they state: “Drawing general conclusions from empirical studies in software engineering is difficult because any process depends to a large degree on a potentially large number of relevant context variables. For this reason, we cannot assume a priori that the results of a study generalize beyond the specific environment in which it was conducted.”

I’m not disputing that TDD is beneficial. I \*am\* saying that the benefits are neither clear, nor obvious … at least at this point in time. In several years time (with a body of evidence) this discussion might appear dated and quaint. As of today (Jan, 2010) I think it’s fair to say the the jury is still out on TDD.

Best regards,
