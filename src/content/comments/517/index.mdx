There is no authoritative definition of Scrum (not even the Scrum guide). Scrum is meant to be incomplete that’s the whole point. Its a framework for getting started on improvement but the framework alone doesn’t solve any of your problems. It just a simple tool to help you discover your problems. How you solve the problems is up to you. For instance most teams want to go faster with higher quality. In that context I find TDD a useful tool, etc. There are other tools for other contexts (hence my ScrumMaster tales series), but not all the tools are applicable in every context.
