Hi Mark

In the first ever planing poker game, the ‘experts’ kept rehashing their numbers. The non-experts nodded, just like you would expect. The problem I was solving with planning poker at the time was to get people to show quickly when they agreed, without the influence of hearing others’ opinions, so we could move on. We could save the discussion for when we did not agree. My experience is that as soon as the discussions starts, there is little hope of stopping it soon.
