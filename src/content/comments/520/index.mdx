This is clearly the first sprint of the project, so it allows for a lot of improvement going forward. Also there dont seem to be any t-shirt sizing of the backlog items done.

So may be in addition to the story rework (that John and Sue can on the day previous to the sprint meeting), John can also start getting the team in t-shirt sizing the “cleaned” up stories. this should be a quick process.

During the sprint planning, the team can start identifying the stories that they believe they will be able to take up. As sprints are time boxed, whatever gets completed within the sprint is what Sue will get. Sue should be set appropriate expectations. The team will learn based on how much they complete the following:  
1\. Details they need from a user story  
2\. How to go about t-shirt sizing and picking up items from the sprint.  
Going forward Sue will get better with her stories and also start getting a more predictable sprint deliverable.
