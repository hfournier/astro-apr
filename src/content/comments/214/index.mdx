Amen re: multi-user chat. Great post. It begs the question, however, of how to integrate between developer productivity/collaboration suites, and chat/IM.

What’s your view on integrating the formal collaboration and workflow of software development, vs. the messy stuff like idea generation, brainstorming, finding historical bug knowledge ”stuck in somebody’s head”, etc?

Like folks here, I’m personally a big proponent of real-time, group-based chat. Not IM, but chat. One-to-one IMs are lousy for group collaboration, and the collective learning that should result. With group chat, you can pose questions to a whole group of folks at once (and everyone learns the answer the same time as you!).

How do others view that? (truth in advertising – I just blogged on this very subject)

Cheers,
