Great post on an important topic, especially to the audience you’re aiming for. I have an anser that some may disagree with, but there’s some really good reasons for it. Riffing on Albert Einstein “Everything should be as simple as possible, and no simpler”: same for stories. This yields one very significant benefit: if it cannot get any simpler, it’s a sure bet that everyone understands it.

There’s a second benefit that works especially well with a controversial “estimating” practice: don’t estimate. During sprint planning teams don’t bother with estimating but instead evaluate each story, starting with the top of the rank-ordered-backlog (no skipping), and answering whether or not they feel confident that they can get the story done in the upcoming sprint. The usual conversations take place to explore any outliers, which usually exposes unknowns and/or misunderstandings. The process stops when the sprint is “full”, meaning as soon as the team cannot agree that they can confidently deliver the story in question.

This non-estimating approach not only saves time and stress, but also cannot be gamed. If a manager is tracking the number of widgets delivered each sprint, the predictable response from a team is to game the system by inflating the story point estimates. When whole stories are what’s being tracked instead, the only way to “game” the system is to have more (i.e. smaller) stories, which actually tends to be a good thing.
