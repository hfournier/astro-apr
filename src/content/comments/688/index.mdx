The assertion that the cost of communication increases when employees work remotely is your opinion and is not based on any real hard evidence. I could just as easily argue that any perceived communication disturbances are negligible at best when team members are skilled at using communication technologies (e.g. instant messengers, email, and the phone). Granted, there are situations when all parties need to be together but this doesn’t happen every day and therefore undermines your argument.

How can you demote the value of individual productivity? What’s worse, you do this with the assumption that when achieved in the context of the individual working remotely there is always a correlation with reduced team productivity. This is utter nonsense! The morons and control-freaks will definitely indulge that belief but the reality is quite opposite to this absurd notion.

Bottom line, just like ‘agile’ needs to be managed to produce the promise of increased value into the development process, so too must communication and collaboration be managed. This can easily achieved by creating a culture that embraces effective communication by taking ownership of conveying mutual understanding. Facial expressions, clothes, perfumes, and in general, appearances ‘can’ be helpful but their mere presence doesn’t mean people can stop thinking critically or analyzing information as it’s being communicated.

The ultimate determinant should be whether or not the work is completed in a timely manner and with enough quality to satisfy the business objective communicated by the product owner. The exact shape of the methods used to achieve this outcome can vary widely and will never be fully figured out because time, people, technology, and culture changes.

Therefore, if you’re Yahoo and need to reign in teams due to performance issues, as you mention, state your goals and don’t think twice. But as Yahoo mentioned in several articles, their decision was not an indictment against people working remotely, it was a tactical decision made to address specific problems they’re facing.
