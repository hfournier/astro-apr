Great article, but note that the first link in it, the one to “Primavera Success Story,” is currently broken.

I’d be particularly interested in knowing what the right link was, as I have recently attended ScrumMaster training with Bob Schatz, who was a key player in the Primavera story.

Thanks,  
Scott
