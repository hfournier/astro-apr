Mark – By the way, I’ve written an article on the mathematics of uncertainty at [https://www.cprime.com/knowledge/articles/uncertainty.html](https://www.cprime.com/knowledge/articles/uncertainty.html). Using very simple math, it provides yet another explanation for why things take longer and cost more than we expect.

Cheers!
