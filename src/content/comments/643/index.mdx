I’d like to nominate Maurce le Rutte. He was my Agile coach and ScrumMaster a few years ago. He’s very passionate about Agile and always willing to have a conversation or discussion about Agile software development.

He blogs in Dutch on https://www.scrummaster.nl/ and in English on  
[https://agilethings.nl](https://agilethings.nl) (one of his articles:  
[https://agilethings.nl/?p=2995](https://agilethings.nl/?p=2995)).

He also tweets on: [https://www.twitter.com/scrumnl](https://www.twitter.com/scrumnl)
