State is part of the interface of a class. This is very frequently forgotten, since it doesn’t get typed in most languages.

The only guarantee that derived classes adhere to that part of your interface is to make the state private. Protected accessor methods are better but no panacaea – the method must take responsibility for making sure state doesn’t change in a way that breaks your interface.
