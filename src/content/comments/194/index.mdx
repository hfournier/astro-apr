Sebastien and Qrilka – I used to think the same way myself. However a well used whiteboard can easily have all the previous iterations to the left and backlog to the right of the current story. So we can have all the history we want.

In addition I’ve never seen the scrum master find a useful nugget buried in the history. When it comes to improvement I usually think the team already knows what it needs. The problem as facilitators is helping them discover it.
