I definitely see the merit in this point of view; ultimately a team delivers value by finishing a story and the number of hours worked is only correlated to value rather than being a direct measure of it. On the other hand, inevitably the number of hours in a sprint far exceeds the number of story points â€“ depending on team size this can even by a factor of 100 or more and therefore visualizing the burn-down in hours rather than story points gives a more granular view. I think the ideal would be to visualize both story points and hours overlain as the relationship between the two lines is in itself telling.
