Thanks for posting the article, I would like to point out that the story is something that describes â€˜Whatâ€™ is to be accomplished. The tasks are something â€˜Howâ€™ it will be accomplished.  
Once we start applying this criteria, it will be very clear when to stop creating smaller story.

As far as number of stories in an iteration are completely dependent on the length of the iteration as well as the number of people and their skills. But I would recommend that the team should be able to deliver a story every 2 or 3 days for acceptance. Some stories that may need more than 3 days, could be scheduled to be accepted later in the iteration.

Other aspect of â€˜Splitting â€˜ the story is the one that is not completed in an iteration but has enough value completed. So we split the story in two, with value delivered and task completed assigned to the current iteration and â€˜incompleteâ€™ part (with reduced points) gets moved to the backlog of the next iteration.
