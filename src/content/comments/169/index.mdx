Its mostly garbage anyway, invented by ‘developers’ in positions of management, who can’t code for shit, pushing the blame back on those that can.

If outcomes aren’t achieved it’s because the coders weren’t agile enough – yeah right!

Lots of stupid meetings that throw actual developer productivity out the window.
