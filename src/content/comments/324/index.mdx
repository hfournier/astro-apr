Mark,

I agree with one or two others who have commented that authors need to see any recommendations that are made. The recommendations are the way we improve our proposals. If recommendations are secret, then submitters have no basis to improve their submissions. We’re just tossing darts in the general direction of the dart-board while blind-folded. I don’t think this has anything to do with noses getting out of joint. After all, we /want/ our sessions to be interesting and valuable.

Think about the way sessions are evaluated for the XP Days Benelux conference. FWIW I think it’s the best-organized agile event on the calendar; the organizers actually apply agile thinking to the task of organizing the conference. It’s the only event I know of that uses a truly open review process, although there are several others that solicit feedback from “anyone” rather than just official reviewers. Submitters and other interested parties openly help improve all the submissions. This not only makes individual session proposals better, but also enables people to eliminate duplicate content, combine proposals, and refine the content of sessions so that there is a coherent flow to the whole event, and so that presenters can be sure they are addressing particular areas of interest to participants. Participants can experience a certain level of continuity and consistency throughout a day’s worth of sessions presented by different people – sessions that weren’t originally conceived as part of a continuum of related content. The result tends to be much better than could be achieved if each submitter worked in isolation and only a few people made decisions about acceptance.

If we talk about all this in Chicago, with Chris and that other Dave guy whose surname is spelled almost the same as mine, maybe we can include one or more of the people involved with that event to see if they might have some ideas we can use for Agile 2010.

Cheers,  
Dave
