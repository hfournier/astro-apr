I’ve experienced that scrum is in no way good for support teams. Typical solutions are to take away time/resources out of the sprint and allocate it to support tasks.

I think that kanban has a lot more advantages when dealing with support tasks. The whole unpredictability of support tasks, makes it hard to plan them in during sprint planning (except for assigning a bucket of time out of which you take time each new task).

Kanban works in a similar way to scrum (board, etc), but it’s main goal is to “limit work in progress” and to make sure the task flow is streamlined.

I’ve toyed with the idea of doing a scrum / kanban combo in a team I work with: 60-70% is planned sprint, 30-40% is kanban. The scrum part is what we commit to feature wise. We fill up the kanban part with “next sprint tasks” equal to the time we have there. If we don’t do them, it’s not bad, if we do, it’s a bonus. The support tasks are added to the kanban part and have precedence over the sprint tasks.

If you have a lot of issues, you do little to none of the “nice to have”/extra features. If you have not that many issues, you do more sprint work.

Kanban tells you to limit the work in progress. So (for instance) only 1-2 tasks could be active in the “in progress” column of your kanban board. This will allow you to manage your support flow, report on it, have separate fix releases based on the kanban flow, but keep the flexibility of adding time to the sprint when it’s calm.
