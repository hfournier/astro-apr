We use a slightly different approach in that we associate tasks to each story and points to each task so from there we can calculate the story points. If you break it up into individual tasks (one trick is finding the righ balance between listing everything you need to do and getting lost in the detail and being too high level), you can begin to figure out how much effort each task will take. That allows you to find consistence in the way you create your tasks and thus your story points.

I agree these are all relative measures and itâ€™s especially hard if you have multiple teams working on completely different projects. And I would never compare the two. They would each have their own set of benchmarks and KPIs. But I have found that getting it down to the task level helps a lot.
