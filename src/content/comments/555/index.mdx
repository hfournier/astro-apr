I have experienced similar issue. I have found similar issues as Mark found. I am trying to use one support story in and one sprint story out way. But I still found that it is not really helpful sometimes. It is more related to how support team access development team, how development team member solve the problem and lack of troubleshooting tools or guide. The first measure after realising real problem, I have tried to block direct support request from support team (Oooh, my god, I have received complains from CEO to service delivery manager). And I try to get a bug fixed properly â€“ documentation, build tools, build more graceful error tracking tools and fix root cause of bugs + deliver result quicker. My intention is to bring wall done after a while when dev team members know how to handle such kind of requests in a proper way instead of always rushing solutions.
