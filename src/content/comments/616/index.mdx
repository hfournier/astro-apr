Howdy Mark,

This is jsomara from twitter. Great start putting this list together. Myself and a few others recommend web\_craftsman to you as one of the great agile voices. This guy is a true master craftsman and has been delighting his customers (and apprentices) with his pragmatic applications of agile for years. He’s a pretty old-school software craftsman and he doesn’t have a blog – intentionally, but he’s taught scores of apprentices and hundreds of customers the benefits of deliberate, thoughtful programming and the agile methodology. He’s convinced an amazing number of non-technical customers to write cucumber tests! He prefers that he keeps his internet persona somewhat anonymous and strictly in the realm of Twitter. You’ve got to respect the past generation for embracing such a youthful medium though!

His greatness is twofold: getting customers bought in and strongly involved in the Agile process, and mentoring fledgling developers (he calls them Apprentices). He’s an amazing teacher, but I understand your list is more about Agile. I met web\_craftsman about a year into his foray into Agile methodology and he was already a true believer. He’s a consultant at a software firm by trade, not an in-house engineer, and he was so thrilled to find a methodology that was both easy for non-technical customers to understand and that produced such excellent, customer-pleasing software. Never in my career as an engineer have I seen another engineer make customers so happy.

I take his request for privacy pretty seriously, but it’s safe to say that you’ve already heard words of recommendation from apprentices and customers alike. Sometimes his customers even \_become\_ apprentices. This guy is unreal. His reach and influence on Twitter will continue to grow as he gets more comfortable with the medium. I understand his anonymity might seem somewhat mysterious – but sometimes social media could use a little mystery.

Good luck with the list – keep on scrummin’!
