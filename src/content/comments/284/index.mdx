It’s funny – once upon a time I was a die-hard advocate of “one entry point, one exit point” for a method or function. My main argument for this was that it greatly simplified debugging. Then, I found out about automated testing in general and TDD in particular and I’ve switched camps to be an advocate of “early returns”!

I would say, though, that early returns don’t necessarily make code less complex. If the code isn’t well-factored to begin with, they can actually make the code less readable. I think that maybe a better way to put this is that if the code has good automated tests and is well-factored (according to Beck’s priority list), then early returns can make it even more readable than nested control structures. There’s a synergy there that needs to be brought to the surface.
