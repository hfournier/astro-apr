Renee I’m not saying it can’t be made to work. I am saying its less productive. I wonder in part what Github and others could be if they were face to face.

It’s a tradeoff and in each case you need to decide what to optimize for.

The final point for Yahoo is they appeared to need to shake up a complacent culture. This change may increase productivity and trigger change.

One of the things I’m learning from my recent reading on habits – to change a habit, changing the environment is key.
