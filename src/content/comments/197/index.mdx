We use a combination approach where I work. During the week, we write hours on the whiteboard, but at the end of the week the story tracker puts them into XPlanner, so that in theory we can track metrics. We actually don’t use XPlanner that effectively, but it’s good to know the data is there.

I really like having the whiteboard, for the reasons you mention, and also the act of writing the numbers on the board always makes me feel more accountable. There’s also the process each week of deciding how to divide up the columns on the whiteboard for tasks, and the constraints of the whiteboard are nice there, because it forces you not to be overly parallel.
