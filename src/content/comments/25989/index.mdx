Hello,  
itâ€™s a great article with useful content.

I am preparing to take the Scrum Master certification and start working as a Scrum Master, so the Scrum articles for example help me understand their reality.

My question is this: when the scum master notices that there is something wrong with the team, they are working in the wrong ways, or they are influenced by the external team, in this case the support team.

What position should the scrum master take? Should he give a solution, or just ask a question and observe.  
I know that the scrum master must observe and raise the problems to the scrum team and ask the right questions to the team to push them to find a solution (coaching). Is this always the case in all situations?

Thanks for all your efforts.
