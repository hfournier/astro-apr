hi Mark,  
I understand and agree with your post. Yet people look for leaders.

Just like you and a lot of thought leaders in the agile community, I look for people outside our community. I think that most interesting things (in every community) happens by people who are not completly inside the community. (Or like Tobias said it so nice, we have a criss-crossed network)  
And even for that we have exceptions, if you look at what Kent Beck has done, you see he was part of the OO community, the patterns community and then the agile community. I think in the agile community we have lots of people who are great to think out of the box. Or maybe better, the thought leaders will not limit their work/thinking because that makes them stay in the community. The funny thing is that people who worship these people are usually people who prefer staying in the box.  
Just like some people had a hard time when Bob Dylan started playing electric guitar. They could not (yet?)see that because Bob was thinking out of the box, he had to go electric.  
I think my thought leaders are the ones that don’t bore me. They push me to see new things.  
And if you agree to that definition, it’s easy to find your own thought leaders.
