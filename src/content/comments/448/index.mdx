Thanks for the cncrete exsamples. Nice. This statement bothers me though…

\> Finally when do you stop splitting? At the lower end no smaller than two developers one or two days. Smaller than that and the stories have effectively become tasks.

This is ambiguous. What constitutes a story has nothing to do with number of developers or days. There is a BIG distinction between a story and a task, that needs to be acknowledged to understand this way of working. A story is a request that has business value (a WHAT/WHY), while a task is simply a thing to do, a step on the way towards the requested value (a HOW).

So my response when I get the question “when do you stop splitting” is “when you are no longer able to formulate the request as a (customer) value statement”.
