My biases are with Toby.

Make it work if it’s important to. Fail if you want. It’s up to management whether they care enough.

The market will sort things out over time.

On the other hand, as individuals hired to address point problems we do our best to be pragmatic. and via agile values doesn’t that mean we can roll out change incrementally? its just a discussion with the client about urgency and importance.
