This week, I just discovered Stephanie Stewart’s “i.am.agile” blog, https://iamagile.com/

She writes, “A blog about an aspiring Agilist and her journey to transform an organization from traditional project management to Agile project management. Stephanie Stewart is Director of Project Management at Valpak.” (See [https://iamagile.com/about/](https://iamagile.com/about/) for more.)

Apparently, in just 3 months of blogging, Stephanie has chronicled a glimpse of her journey together with her team mates at Valpak (Tampa, FL). Coming from traditional PM (16 years) they have been drawn toward the bright light of agile collaboration. Over the past 8 or 9 months, Stephanie and her colleagues have transformed themselves into passionate, born-again “Agile Project Leaders!” See their birth announcement and new job description, posted just this week, at https://iamagile.com/2012/05/22/the-birth-of-the-agile-project-leader/  
Kudos to Stephanie Stewart and her colleagues at Valpak!

In her insightful “Light Bulb” post last month, she wrote “…I genuinely enjoy talking to others about the Agile transformation taking place here at Valpak. It’s a great story and I love to share it!” \[NOTE: That is one post I’d like \*everyone\* to read. Don’t miss it!!! ~KCR\] [https://iamagile.com/2012/04/20/an-agile-light-bulb-moment-forming-projects-around-teams/](https://iamagile.com/2012/04/20/an-agile-light-bulb-moment-forming-projects-around-teams/  )

So, I nominate Stephanie (iamagile.com) as a new “Agile Voice” we should hear more from.

Cheers,
