Re: VNC

VNC’s security is terrible unless it is tunneled through SSH, at which point the performance drops to ugly. FreeNX/NoMachineNX has better compression algorithm support and a better security profile than VNC.

\> Isn’t all the open source developed at a distance?

Not all; more to the point, there are lots of great open source projects out there that have wonderful functionality and really ugly code. The open source projects that really are flagship operations are apache and firefox, and they may be open source projects but they’re not exactly open communities.

\> the skill level of developers makes the difference

Change “skill” to “discipline” and I’ll agree with this statement. There are lots of coders out there that are brilliant but undisciplined – having a bunch of really talented but ad-hoc programmers trying to operate while in a distance environment is going to give you a cruddy final product. I’ve met more than a few people who have had the “rock star” label hung on them, and while they may be able to tear apart and rebuild code amazingly fast and remarkably bug-free, there is a very small percentage of them that can do so while producing code that anyone can read. I’m not a programmer myself, admittedly, but in the systems administration business “what happens if Joe gets hit by a truck” is one of the first questions a good sysadmin asks. That should hold true in programming projects as well.
