We are using electronic tool for more than one year. We use historical data to get better estimation of the next sprint. We can easily compare stories size. Our product owner uses the same management tool as development team use. She is very easy able to collaborate directly with team members. Moreover she doesn’t need to be personnally at daily scrum meeting. I cannot imagine how can distributed teams collaborate by using a whiteboard only. Electronic tool make such collaboration easier and “live”.

Another advantage is an integration with other tools. I mean version systems, bug tracking, project homepages (wiki).

The first version of this tool fully support “no login and go” principle. We had a case when product owner required a protection of his ideas and requirements. So that’s the reason why we started to use a login.

I think, that it is not necessary to learn how to interact with tools. You can use intuitive tools instead. Try to look for example on [https://www.scrumdesk.com](https://www.scrumdesk.com). Basically it’s desk with story cards, burndown chart and next sprint stories.
