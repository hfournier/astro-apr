Mark,

Good question, however wouldnâ€™t this compare to saying that a Scrum Master is not needed for the team because they should all be responsible for the process?

I would argue that just as a Scrum Master is a critical roll for a team to facilitate the Scrum Process and help the team learn to own this responsibility, an Agile Architect may be used to help a team learn these architecture/refactoring best practices. The best Scrum Master (and I would argue Agile Architect) would be the one that embodies his knowledge into the team so they can do it themselves and the Scrum Master (or Architect) could move on to other more important things.

My $0.02
