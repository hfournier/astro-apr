Robert – typically we hold sprint planning meetings in front of the white board. In one case where that didn’t work we moved the white board to the room where planning occurred.

As for clients having access to the sprint status – brilliant. As long as it doesn’t come at the expense of the team. If you can find a way of doing it that doesn’t burden the team or inhibit conversation then go for it.
