Svkaria – there are a few Questions:  
Are there clear boundaries on who is on and not on the team? The Scrum events (Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, etc) are for the whole team. If that includes QA etc then they should present. (Hint they should be on the team)

The other people working on different projects – are they normally part of your development team? In which “ask the team” what they think is the most valuable use of their time.

If they’re not normally part of your team don’t involve them.
