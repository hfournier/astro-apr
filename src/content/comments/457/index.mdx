Very interesting Andrew – I’d never considered it that way. I tend to use the trailing average approach, but I do see your point about letting them off the hook. It really depends on how you use velocity. I see it as a planning tool and way of seeing roughly how far you will get through your backlog before the end of the project. In that case I probably want the trailing average over 3 sprints. I would find another way to address the over commitment issue.
