Just what I needed! It’s 10:00 p.m. already, and I still have 5 things on today’s list of things to do.

Yesterday’s list is buried under today’s, and it hasn’t been finished either.

I will take a look at My Life Organized tomorrow, and I’ve already sent myself an email to remind me to put it on tomorrow’s list of things to do.

Thanks so much for the tip!
