Great post, Mark, and hello from a fellow Ontarian (I live in Sault Ste. Marie). Iâ€™ve been working as a remote project manager for two companies for just a few months, both doing attempting to do agile, without having studied it in depth. Iâ€™m now doing that, and in our case everyone works from home in multiple countries, about as remote and distributed as you can get.

Tools we are currently using / evaluating that I like:

1\. IRC for real-time chat. Most IRC clients keep a history of conversations. Skype.com and FreeConference.com used for voice chats.

2\. Just started evaluating Rally (www.rallydev.com) and am quite impressed with it so far, the first agile tool that has me excited. The free version allows up to 10 users on one project.

3\. Google docs, great for accessing / sharing and collaborating on.

4\. Project mailing lists for easier email conversations and archiving.

Iâ€™m looking forward to trying out Mind Meister and Planning Poker. ðŸ™‚
