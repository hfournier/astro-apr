I don’t see how that approach makes sense. What Ron says there is that you don’t track technical debt at all, you just do each story better and so by getting closer to your definition of done in terms of testing and refactoring, the problem just goes away by itself.

I see two problems with that.

1\. Developers don’t have task tracking systems built into their brains. If some hard discovered piece of technical debt is not tracked then it’s highly likely that it will be forgotten about until the next time it is rediscovered, the hard way, when something goes tits up or takes twice as long to implement as it otherwise should have.

2\. The effort required to remedy the issue is not tracked anywhere and so represents an error in the work remaining to project velocity calculation. This error will accumulate for every piece of technical debt that it is assumed will just go away naturally as more stories are done.
