Good clarification! I like the 2 people half sprint, rule of thumb. That seems both sufficiently small and large.

Sometimes user-stories can, however, also be too small. The rule of thumb I use for that is: when a user-story seems sufficiently clear by itself to start developing the software directly, then it is propably too small! After all, a user-story is: an invitation to a conversation.

When user-stories can be used as documented requirements (they do not require any form of interaction anymore) they seem too small.
