Thanks Mark. Regarding the reporting, I expressed myself in a wrong way. Currently we are introducing the Kanban method step by step in an evolutionary way. An electronic board and the created reports would help us, the team, to check if our own estimations were correct and how much throughput we can have. It’s about getting a feeling for the estimations using Kanban.  
So it’s not for the management (that is interested more in results), but for ourselves.
