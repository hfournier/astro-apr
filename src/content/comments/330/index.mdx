First; I love your post. It summarize so much that is almost taboo to talk about. What I lacked was that agile development does not work for all types of developers. One guy I’ve had the privilege to work with did not come to his right in an agile environment. My just building a solution around his strengths he grew and became a better developer than ever. But had he hanged on an agile team, he would have lost confidence in himself, become worse or quit.

The problem I’ve had is when you’ve come to the point that the problem has been identified but management does not handle it.

The situations I have in mind is when a poor performer has been recruited and management does not want to handle this. In many of these cases, this was identified by one or two team members before recruiting, but this was not taken seriously. In other cases, the recruitment was made in haste and it wasn’t really thought through. Well thought through recruitment processes, early feed back, not hiring people when a team member opposes the person should be considered. Work tests and collaboration tests are good. One should never take for granted that a developer who says he has ten years experience is a senior developer. And just because he know the buzz words in agile software development does not make him an agile developer. And if the wrong person has been hired, take it seriously and have a plan for it. It does not get better by just hiding the fact.

Like always, I write too long comments. But great thanks for this post, which I’m forwarding to all my friends in a management position on agile software projects.
