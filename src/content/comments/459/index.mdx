“5 – 10 stories a sprint” for how many developers working what length of sprint?

Ten stories sounds OK but is still not great for 5 developers working a two week sprint. Developers are good at math, and can quickly figure out that we’re talking about an average of 1 story getting done every 4 days assuming 25% drag or 6 ideal hours a day. The “5 – 10 stories a sprint” guideline would be pretty bad interpreted by a team of 9 developers working a 3 or 4 week sprint.

I understand the desire some have to keep time out of these discussions, yet I don’t think suggesting a range of stories for a sprint makes it any less ambiguous. I would think that here it makes sense to provide the advice in days. When coaching a team, taking into consideration the size of the team and length of the sprint, you could use a range of stories which I agree would be preferable. Maybe this example could be further amended to include a suggested team size and sprint duration for which 10 stories would be reasonable?
