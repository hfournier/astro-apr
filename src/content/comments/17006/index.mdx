Dave – there isn’t a correct answer as to what to do. The most important thing as a team is to learn about not doing this over and over.

On the pragmatic right now front? You can either:  
– Declare the Story unfinished or  
– Call it finished and log a bug

I prefer the former because it sends the stronger signal in the long run. The team is there to deliver quality and not bugs. When they just log a bug the message is the quality was good enough and we fix the problems later.
