Stefan: pairing over a remote connection – I use Real VNC (or any other VNC). The other developer can see my machine and has much control as I do. Caveat Emptor – this is huge security risk, don’t run the server when you don’t need it. Only run it over an internal network or VPN, ….

BTW its not like the real thing. Nonetheless if you’re not sitting together its better than a boot to the head.

Greg: I don’t know much about the details of the study. The other claims are merely based on mine and other’s experience. As I recall you’re a prof – you have students maybe you could run experiements on them. I must admit I tend not to look for formal proofs in a case like this. I tried it for a while, discovered it works and wouldn’t go back.

I challenge anyone – try it for six weeks and see if you would go back afterwards.
