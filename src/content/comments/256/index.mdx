AFAIK, the term “engineering practices” is a relatively new one and came out of the Scrum community. I first recalling hearing it used by Tobias Mayer.

All of the practices that make up XP come from somewhere else. XP itself was an evolution of the practices Kent Beck was using at the time he was working the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation project. The term Extreme Programming referred to the idea of taking a certain set of practices which worked really well, and doing them all, together, all the time, to the exclusion of anything else. Thus taking the things that work and pushing them to the extreme.

XP may sound a bit… well, extreme. However, I find that when people understand the meaning of the term they are less likely to object to it.

I was on the XP list back in 2002/2003. As for zealotry I plead the Fifth.
