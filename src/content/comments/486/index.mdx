Hi Mark. Good message, and good post, in principle, although undermined by the mention of the usual (thought-leader) suspects. Puzzled why you did that. There are of course people we pay attention to, and learn from, but happily this is not hierarchical but rather a criss-crossed network. I have found that the people worth paying attention to are those that think for themselves and (like you) draw ideas from other disciplines as well as through dialog with those in the community, old-timers and newcomers alike.

Peter Block suggests we eschew leadership in favor of citizenship. Now thatâ€™s an idea that aligns with Agile thinking.
