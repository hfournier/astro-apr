Surprisingly, there is little clear evidence that TDD is beneficial. After a question was raised on a forum that I regularly read, I spent several days reading the current literature on TDD … case studies, reports, recommendations etc. The vast majority of studies and reports simply don’t reach any firm conclusions. And, for every article that promoted certain properties of TDD there are an equal number of articles demoting those same properties.

All this came as a surprise to me because I had assumed that the benefits of TDD were a forgone conclusion … based on personal experience and practice of TDD.

What is very clear is that there is a correlation between the number of tests and clarity (simplicity) of the code. Quoting from your article: “measuring a over 20 projects: if you have a large number of unit tests your code will be an order of magnitude less complex.” I would like to point out that one doesn’t need to practice TDD, to have a lot of unit tests. There are other ways to achieve the same end.

I absolutely agree with the sentiment of your post and Dave’s comments above, especially the following quote: “It’s interesting that many of those who question the effectiveness of TDD never seem to question the effectiveness of traditional methods …” I would also like to point out that the benefits of TDD are not clear nor are they immediately apparent.
