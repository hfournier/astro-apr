Some people say daily standups are micromangement; some people say they aren’t.

Whether this is a good list or not, or whether micromangement is good or not, I’d have to say, this list smells like micromanagement.

Additionally q’s 4 and 5 could also be made forward looking (what will you improve today), etc, so this would be quite the long daily meeting.

Ultimately I think q’s 4 and 5 should be part of retrospectives and whatever improvements noted assigned as real scheduled tasks.
