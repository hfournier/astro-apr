Micheal – first of all thanks for taking the time to comment. You’re right a weak developer who isn’t interested in improving their code quality will still produce crappy code. In fact a better way of saying it – you can TDD crap. Here’s the thing if I’m coaching your team then one of our goals will be to help improve the code quality.

From my own experience I can only say that I do see the difference when I write the tests first – it forces me to stay focused and simplify the code. I don’t worry about the cases I’m not testing for yet and often they turn to be irrelevant. Perhaps you don’t have the same experience.

You say that TDD has too many loopholes where its not feasible and cost effective – I’m not sure what you mean. What are these cases? If your already doing POUT, why won’t TDD work?

I’m sorry that you’ve found TDD working for you – I suggest only you consider trying it again, perhaps using Coding Katas or [Coding Dojos](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/tdd-randori-workshop.html). Perhaps it won’t work for you – but remember at the core of Agile we keep an open mind.
