Loved this post, Mark. We shop at several different grocery stores and for the most part, they don’t get it. In particular, the phrase “the store doesn’t make money until you’ve paid”.

As a customer, I can definitely pick up on the energy of the employees and their motivation to perform non-cashier roles, or to initiate the opening of a cash register. The more centralized the action, the less they actually open, and the less I feel valued as a customer.

The one exception to your post seems to be Wal-Mart. The lines there are few and always infernally long — and business is booming. I guess they can get away with anything at the prices they charge.
