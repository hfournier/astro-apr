“Work in any way” is nice but where do you get started… This is the moment I pull the SHU-HA-RI card. It is not stupid to look at different exsiting frameworks, methodologies,… for ideas. For Scrum I would even advise to strictly apply Scrum (SHU) and see what it brings to your team (HA) and finally adapt it to fit your team’s needs (RI). Also, the idea with Agility is that a team will retrospect and try new ideas to improve the ways of working by learning from recent experience, improve and moving forward.
