What about the case where the software is highly technical, for instance, Geology and Geophysics exploration software, that requires a certain amount of specialization, usually a MS degree in one or the other of the two disciplines to understand the science behind the software in order to write a useful test. Most User stories do not have the depth to tell the developer how it will be used correctly. For instance: Joe the geologist wants to pick a fault on a vertical seismic amplitude display section along crossline 200, starting at 2.4 msec in formation A continuing to the bottom of formation D utilizing one seed point in each of the four formations. That sounds pretty simple, but there might be a lot of information that the geologist persona knows that the developer does not. I find that the Product Manager who writes the User Stories usually leaves out a lot of information expecting the Geologist or Geophysicist tester in QA to “know” whereas the Developer does not. I can see some of the benefits of the method evaporating in the convoluted path needed to actually put in into play for very specialized software projects.
