Thanks! This was a great overview of problems at the end of the sprint. For us, our biggest problem is we’re finding that some user stories that were put in the active sprint were incorrect. Should bugs be created against the user story? Currently we’re explaining the deviations in the discussion thread for the work item but the discussion threads are often overlooked.
