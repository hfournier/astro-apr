Mark,  
In my opinion, whether the technique is intentionally relative ala Scrum or attempts to be absolute like function points, both suffer from the imprecision of the information used as the basis of estimation.  
However, the fact that Scrum is looking at a subset of the project complexity implemented over a few weeks means that the team is more likely to have an accurate idea of what is to be accomplished compared with an estimator using function points at the beginning of a waterfall project.  
It would be an interesting experiment to have a function point specialist work with an agile team to convert user stories to Internal Logical Files/ External Interfaces / External Inputs / External Outputs / External Inquiries and estimate the function points for each sprint. Then compare the function points per developer over successive sprints with similar projects in the literature and with the velocity as calculated by the team.
