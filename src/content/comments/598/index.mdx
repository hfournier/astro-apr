Nice post. Glad to see the analysis, all of it. The conclusion in the opening sentence of the analysis was a smell from the first sentence of the piece “ScrumMaster John has finally found someone to fill the role…”.

The pairing idea is pretty commonplace these days, especially for this position. Well done.
