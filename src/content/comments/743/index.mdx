clearly this is bad communication between management and team (both ways), without wrapping it up in Scrum catechism. Unpack the situation and itâ€™s simply a matter of execs, management and scrum team unable to drive a situation where all parties understand all needs, and an effective prioritisation approach is developed. I am a strong supporter of agile approaches, but sometimes I wonder whether all the scrum process and language alienates management and enables team to not find the right solution. I agree that in terms for formal Scrum, John was not strong enough, and did not present options to Ellen in her terms or a way that she could understand. But I see a lot of this type of situation, largely driven by a wholehearted adoption of scrum but with poor execution.
