I agree with most – have issues with foreach. At the moment, I am dealing with serious speed issues to handle a massive ammount of rows in a table. I Killed foreach early on due to it’s speed. Actually, in an almost direct conflict with “fewer lines of code”, when programming for speed, I’ve found the need in many places to \*add\* more lines of code (unrolling loops, etc, cause quite a bit more code).

dealing with Javascript (or most interpreted languages), small variables in a loop massively speed things up as well.

Just from experience…
