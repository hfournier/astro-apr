Hi Mark,

Cool project youâ€™re undertaking here. Iâ€™d like to add a couple of others to your list for consideration.

1) Ilan Goldstein

Twitter = @ilagile  
Blogs at [https://www.scrumshortcuts.com/blog](https://www.scrumshortcuts.com/blog)

I  
was surprised to find that heâ€™s not on either the Noop list of the  
AgileScout list. He blogs about techniques and approaches that heâ€™s  
tried and tested in the real world. Iâ€™ve paid more and more attention to  
him as his blog has helped me solve my own issues on more than one  
occasion. Heâ€™s also got a book coming out soon as part of the Cohn  
Signature Series and is speaking at Agile Australia 2012. Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s a  
name weâ€™ll be hearing more and more but I reckon heâ€™s a good find for  
your list. Will be good to see what comes out in his book.

2) Martin Kearns  
Twitter = @kearnsey  
Canâ€™t find a blog but have heard him speak a few times. Video of him can be found here â€“ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXS\_myJK5Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXS_myJK5Y) and here â€“ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcrs7meE4Vw

Heâ€™s a passionate Agilist, a Certified Scrum  
Coach and is one of the advisors for Agile Australia 2012 and does lots  
to further Agile in Australia. I guess you donâ€™t hear much form him  
because the company he works for does a lot of â€˜privateâ€™ coaching for  
large organisations in Australia but his influence in getting Agile  
transitions happening at the tough end of town canâ€™t be overlooked.

Enjoy my 2 Australian cents (which is worth more than it has ever been based on our favourable exchange rates) ðŸ™‚
