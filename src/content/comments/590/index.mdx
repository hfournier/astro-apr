I organize two groups in which we generally practice through Katas: [https://cincycleancoders.com](https://cincycleancoders.com) and [https://daytoncleancoders.com](https://daytoncleancoders.com). We most often use Randori katas at the Cincy group.

This came out of similar problems and exercises with a few teams I worked with as a coach. Great stuff.
