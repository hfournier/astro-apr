Carefully note, the “bug count” is not a measure of quality.  
Stating that some “teams had 2.5 more defects” is factually incorrect. You should state that “teams had 2.5 times more \*documented\* defects”.  
This may simply mean that these teams (which had more defects) were more active in testing and documenting the defects found.

There is no control group or variable, making that statement impossible to understand.
