I agree with Dave.

In well-factored code, early returns are fabulous. I use them all the time to dispose of contract violations and degenerate cases, so that the method code can focus on the interesting part of the problem.

They can also be nice when expressing a simple set of rules. E.g., in a Java equals method, I often find it much more readable to express it as a series of “if … return” lines rather than one giant boolean expression. And I’m sure they have other uses as well.

In ugly code, I do think they can make things mildly uglier. But I think the solution there is refactoring for clarity, not adding rules to try to make mud slightly less dirty.
