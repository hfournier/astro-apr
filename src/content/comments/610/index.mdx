The two major lists are:  
[https://www.noop.nl/2009/09/top-200-blogs-for-developers-q3-2009.html and](https://www.noop.nl/2009/09/top-200-blogs-for-developers-q3-2009.html and )  
[https://agilescout.com/top-agile-blogs-200/](https://agilescout.com/top-agile-blogs-200/ )

I hadn’t included refs to them in the original post because I didn’t want to draw more attention to them. I figured since this was my idea it was responsibility to check names.

Cheers
