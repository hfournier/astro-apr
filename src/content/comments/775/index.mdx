I am surprised that Intra Team Coordination and Team Organization are not referred to as project management especially now that organizations are beginning to consider Large Scale Scrum and Enterprise Scrum. It seems to me that it is time for scrum to finally accept project management as one of its essential element to be successful at the large scale/enterprise scrum.
