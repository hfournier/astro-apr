Thanks Taffit – the tool is LeanKit – however the focus on reporting concerns me. A Portfolio wall isn’t about reporting, its about helping people see what the issues are working with the peers to resolve them. If you management need a “report” they should get it by stepping out of their offices and coming to see the wall. If a co-located team switch to an electronic tool much of the value of this approach will get lost.
