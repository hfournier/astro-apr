Thanks Mark for this useful overview that shows why it’s important to have stable teams.

I have similar experiences, it takes time for people to learn each other and find effective ways to collaborate. A lot also depends on the culture. I’ve worked with one organization where there people where allowed (and stimulated) to collaborate outside their project. They developed their soft skills, and the organization as a whole became more flexible to changes.
