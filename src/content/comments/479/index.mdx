The fathers of Lean were impressed by how the USA supermarket shelves were filled throughout the day, by using the shelf space as a sort of Kanban token within a “pull system”. So instead of a fancy inventory control system tapped into the POS system, the shelf stockers just looked for empty shelf space, and figured out JIT that those items were selling fast (i.e. pulled by customers) – so needed restocking. One of the first “pull systems” – brilliant in its simplicity!
