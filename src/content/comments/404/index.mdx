Your right, I should have added familiarity with the development process as a factor in the cost of adding people. Upon reflection, I would add whether the person has fixed or growth mindset, see Mindset, The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck, [https://tinyurl.com/26r2ljn](https://tinyurl.com/26r2ljn), who is a professor of Psychology at Standford. The latter type of people will adapt faster then the former.
