Working from home has been proven to improve employee engagement. I don’t doubt that it costs more in communication/effort to get it working well, but many organisations have done it successfully without the detriment of the business and its delivery. Take Github as an example, an organisation fully enabled to work where you want – engagement is high, productivity and collaboration is high.
