I agree that a User Story has nothing to do with the number of developer days, but people still need some guidance when they start out about the lower bound for a story. If had phrased it better I would still use the number of days, but add that its not a story anymore its a task.

Your statement about “customer value” is right but will gives people an easy out to stop splitting when the story is still larger than a single sprint. I use people days to help people get a real sense of how small these often are. Otherwise I often find people who think that a Story taking a 2-3 sprints is ok.

Cheers
