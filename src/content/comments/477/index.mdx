Michelle – thanks for taking the time to comment. While the training is difficult I gather management has made it clear “help the customer purchase groceries is the only priority”. A clear goal is necessary to making self organization work.

I’ve also discovered several of the staff have moved to this store from a large Canadian grocery chain because of the customer focus.
