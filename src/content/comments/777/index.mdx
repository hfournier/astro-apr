Thanks Mark.

Thank you for commenting on my remarks.

Thank you also for the link to the presentation about Nokia. It is interesting that the researchers from Insead found that the core driver of the failure of Nokia had everything to do with a prevailing “culture of temperamental leaders and frightened middle managers, scared of telling the truth”.

You can probably say the same thing about the demise of Blockbuster in the U.S and Blackberry/Research In Motion in Canada.

You are right, we should not be too picky about titles.

Unfortunately, I often see project management and scrum being discussed as mutually exclusive domains with project management or any project coordination role often vilified in the process.

I just don’t see project management or roles responsible for coordination as the real problem for projects. Failure of these roles is more often that not due to the prevailing culture in an organization and the type of behaviors it tends to reward and people it promotes to these roles.

I often say organizations get the managers they deserve.

As for self-organizing teams capable of cross-coordination, perhaps my 20+ years of project experience, primarily in typical (traditional) IT shops in non-technology organizations, made me a lot more pessimistic about organizations being able to foster truly self-organizing teams. I know it is dangerous to generalize but perhaps self-organization is the norm in some technology companies but I just don’t see it happening elsewhere, especially when we are talking about large project, regardless of the type of industry.

I just don’t see it happening in the near future either.

Thank you again.
