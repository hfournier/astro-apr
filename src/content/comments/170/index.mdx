Honestly, Mark, to me you donâ€™t come across as fanatical! â€˜Course, maybe thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m dogmatic about the same things as you. ðŸ˜‰

I posted a blog entry a while back called Agile Circa 1988 ([https://agileartisan.blogspot.com/2006/02/agile-circa-1988.html](https://agileartisan.blogspot.com/2006/02/agile-circa-1988.html)) about a team I worked with from 1992-1998. Prior to a forced marriage with a large, monolithic govâ€™t department, that group was as Agile as any Iâ€™ve seen. I worked with a group more recently that started with agile practices, but devolved over time and is now pretty well back to classic waterfall, albeit with 4 month releases.
