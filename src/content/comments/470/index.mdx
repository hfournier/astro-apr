Ok I could have stated it better. Acceptance criteria can come from anyone on the team. However I find they most of come the PO and QA.

As to when: sometimes they’re discovered as part of estimation and sometimes not.

However I wrote this item to clear up some large scale mis-conceptions (i.e. Backlog grooming what’s that), I realize there won’t be full agreement on some of the fine details.
