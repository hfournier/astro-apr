I’d like to hear from Alex Viggio, Brad Swanson, and Somnath Ghosh of Agile Denver. They’ve quietly and capably lead the Agile Denver organization, including instigating and operating Mile High Agile 2011 and Mile High Agile 2012. They tend to be quiet organizers and I’d like to hear more of what they’ve learned as practitioners.
