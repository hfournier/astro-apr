Foaud – As usual in the game of Scrum there are several stock answers: It depends and Ask the team. The later is the most important piece of Scrum advice, the team know more than we do.

Now a more serious answer. I see the ScrumMaster’s role is to help the team to become more effective in the long run. If you solve their problem right now, they will learn the the ScrumMaster is good at solving their problems. I would prefer the team learn to solve their own problems. So my preference is to ask questions and observe. If you’re worried that things will blow up then make it safe to fail, help them find an approach where failure can easily be unwound.
