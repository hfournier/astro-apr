PA – words on a page are very difficult in that they don’t convey all of the meaning.

If a ScrumMaster or I as an outside coach impose Questions #1 and #2 you’re right that would be micromanagement. New Agile teams are often struggling to learn how to make and meet \*\*small\*\* commitments. In their case I ask this idea and other options and ask what they think will meet their needs. So if they do this they choose not me.

Questions #4 and #5 can be phrased any way the team wants forward/backward looking. Rather than impose again I ask the team what will work for them. Backward looking questions give the team the advantage of finding something small to celebrate everyday. The point isn’t to replace the retrospective but to celebrate small successes in achieving our goals. Its easier to make improvements when your peers recognize that they happened and celebrate in some small way.

Cheers
