Worrying about splitting stories to fit into arbitrary iterations is wasteful. Teams should understand and focus on delivering business value and not breaking work into arbitrary time-boxes. Sure, keep it small, but if you have a big feature that is hard to decompose, then just build it and move on rather than play games about splitting stories and pretending they still have business value. This is why Kanban with XP practices is growing as an alternative to Scrum.
