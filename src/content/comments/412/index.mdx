Martin Fowler was right: it \*is\* impossible to measure output, and hence productivity. I discovered the reason why when doing research for Symbian on software quality metrics: Kolmogorov-Chaitin-Solomonoff complexity, an analogue to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem that tells us that it is fundamentally impossible to measure the complexity (and hence size) of any computer program over a certain trivial size (see J.P. Lewis 2001).

This little known academic work helps explain why so many software projects fail, and why we find it so hard to estimate software complexity, size, cost etc.

Even Tom DeMarco, who started the whole ‘you cannot control what you cannot measure’ malarkey now admits he was wrong, see [https://bit.ly/pRrkd](https://bit.ly/pRrkd)
