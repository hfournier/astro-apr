It takes some courage to setup the dojo the first time. But after one positive experience, the team will not go back  
I also liked the use of design patterns â€“ design patterns should be means, not goals in their own right. there is great advantage to know design patterns. but one must appreciate that they are not a solution in their own right  
Thanks for an encouraging post!
