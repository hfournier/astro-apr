I have an interesting political challenge which I sort of rigged my self into since I moved from a mature agile organization to the other that just adopted agile.

We used to and still do display story points as delivery on commitment/promise and to track velocity. however few in execs have started to understand that as productivity and have asked how can we increase story points from 30 to 50 or above as then we know team is performing awesome and their productivity is increasing otherwise 30 or ballpark story points delivered reflects team is not improving. if someone could share nice articles which I can accompany with with my own examples that would be awesome. or any other strategies to answer this question.
