Beautiful metaphor — “a scapel and not a butcher’s knife.”

I think the key is leading with “why” … “why” do we even use stories?

Stories help us bridge with the customer, know what good looks like, and estimate our work. So pairing stories down is fine, and a good thing, as long as we can still achieve those basic goals.

Stepping back, one confusion I always see is the “user story” vs. the “developer story.” (where the user story is split into developer tasks.)

I think there are actually two other problems folks run into but don’t realize it:  
1\. cuttable scope (having stories that make it easy to cut scope or deliver incremental value and translate to something stakeholders can underestand.)  
2\. keeping bigger stories and litter stories organized. This is actually a solved problem, but you have to borrow from “scenario trees” or “utility trees” (and I’ve found Mind Maps to be the best vehicle.)
