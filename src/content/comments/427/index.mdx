Madhan – thanks for taking the time to comment. “Two people for half an iteration” is a rough measure of the maximum story size:

Two people implies that getting a story to “Done” always requires at least two people working together.  
Half an iteration – any story that is longer than half an iteration will be a bottleneck and is unlikely to be completed by the end of the sprint

If you want to see what happens when a team doesn’t split their stories to relatively small size, see: [ScrumMaster Tales The Story of an Incomplete Sprint](https://agilepainrelief.com/blog/scrummaster-talesthe-story-of-an-incomplete-sprint.html)
