Hello Mark,  
I agree that we should propagate the over committing of stories but as time and again we have found if the Product Owner makes the call that there is value delivered for the project, he/she has asked the team to split the story and more than 50% of the time, the remaining components were actually moved down in the priority. The customer satisfaction and working software are the main goals of Agile, how you get there is of less importance.

It is very similar to Kanban principle, keep the waste to a minimum.
