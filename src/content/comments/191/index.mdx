Thanks for the post. For sprint planning meetings with the client, what do you suggest using so that everyone is looking at the same information (i.e. where do you keep the product backlog)? Also, what are your thoughts on the client having access to the project status (at all times) as long as they have the understanding that once a sprint starts they cannot change things? Thanks!
