Mark,  
Well – it’s javascript that I am working in, but most interpreted languages work the same. To be honest, I searched the net for timings on all things js before attempting to make my grid work faster. I got massive speed increases when not using foreach and by unrolling the loops. probably around 400% faster or better. Other speed increases came from using arrays to joing strings instead of concatenating, etc – but when dealing with over 10,000 rows consisting of 5 or more cells each – every microsecond is seriously worth the trouble.

I wish I could give you more on the foreach other than my personal experience and “best Guess” – which is that in a foreach loop, each iteration has more calculations etc to do in order to “figure” out what it is that “Each” means, but if I iterate through an array of objects I am directly accessing the pointer via it’s index – no calcs required.

My grid loads 3000 rows in about 17 seconds with all of the functionality of the infragistics WebGrid (which takes closer to 2 and 1/2 minutes to render). Through the above tweaks, I gained much in the manner of speed.

For Compiled languages – I may just do the same for consistency sake though – unless I find a bottleneck! 😉
