Mike – We’re in broad agreement, a 2 day course hints at the basics of doing Scrum well at the team level. Scaling is an art form and each artist advises something slightly different. At this stage Scaling isn’t well enough codified to be part of any canon (Scrum, Lean, Kanban, …). We know that we need more than the basics of Scrum. Maybe in 4-5 yrs it will be clear what the successful patterns were. My original reaction was to your comment about the “Scrum Canon” (which I hope never exists).

There is lots of good ideas on how to scale Scrum and some it even comes from the usual suspects.

Back to revising our creativity presentation and paper for Salt Lake City.

Cheers  
Mark
