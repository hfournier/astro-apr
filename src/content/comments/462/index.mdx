Mixing it up is a great technique. If nothing else, it keeps it interesting. Sometimes Iâ€™ll take something from our retrospective or from a BVC and make that the extra question for the iteration.

In addition, I often go down the card wall instead of going around the room at the iteration mid-point and on the last day of the iteration.
