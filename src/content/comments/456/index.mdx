Let’s consider that for a moment. In this case, the next sprint’s velocity will be decidedly too high. It can’t be used alone for Yesterday’s Weather. So, one solution is to use an average velocity. That makes the math work, but, to me, seems to let the team off the hook again. “So, we’ll finish it next sprint. What’s the big deal? It averages out in the wash.” I’m inclined to give zero points for the completed portion (this iteration) and come up with a new lower estimate for the remaining work (for next iteration). This makes Yesterday’s Weather seemingly too low and that will create discussion. It’s this painful feedback that serves to reinforce the need to meet iteration commitments. What do you think?

More importantly, not meeting an iteration’s commitments raises all kinds of issues and is best avoided.
