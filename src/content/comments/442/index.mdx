I like the idea of the simplest it can be. I do really like velocity though. As I tell my team all the time, story points arenâ€™t for them. They should do sprint planning just the way you say. Story points are for the PO and SM when they are planning releases. They are for future estimating and I have found them to be invaluable when reporting back to the organization when we think we can get to what.
