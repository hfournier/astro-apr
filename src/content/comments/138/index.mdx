I haven’t used RMock or EasyMock in anger, but have grown to really like JMock; despite all its faults. It had been adopted already by a project I joined mid-way through, but at that point not really used extensively. Now I hardly write a line of code that isn’t exercised by it.

Admittedly, the string based approach is a real limitation when refactoring.

Just a couple of points to help with your annoyances…

I’m not sure why you would want to set up an expectation for something you don’t care about, but you can specify an exact number of invocations with exactly(expectedCount).

You can mock Classes with JMock using CGLIB.  
See [https://www.jmock.org/jmock1-cglib.html](https://www.jmock.org/jmock1-cglib.html)
