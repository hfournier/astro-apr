Mark, it is not enough to publish a report. We have to present the necessary information from which conclusions can be made üôÇ

Rally did a very poor job at doing proper research on that data (the defect count being only one example).

All data should be public, otherwise no one can refute either of their ‚Äúconclusions‚Äù.

BTW: I‚Äôve published data on 22 different projects with their iteration-by-iteration data. Check it here: [https://bit.ly/NoEstimatesProjectsDB](https://bit.ly/NoEstimatesProjectsDB)

We need the original data‚Ä¶
