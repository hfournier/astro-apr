Shardul – I agree the role is hard to play well. I give PO’s two rules of thumb:  
– Split your time 50% Customer, 50% Team  
– Most of the time you should be able to answer a question in ~2-3hrs.

From there I ask them to do what make sense.

I agree that the team should spend time with the customer (easier if you’re in IT shop vs ISV). I also agree that the role is hard to play well.

So I think we’re mostly in agreement here.
