Iâ€™d go with the grooming meeting first, dealing with splitting the stories into smaller chunks (could be done the day before grooming though) and getting the teamâ€™s estimates on them.  
That shouldnâ€™t hurt too much if the sprint is larger than a week. In any case, keep in mind thatâ€™s the beginning and you have the first signal on where to improve.  
Relax and try to keep the teamâ€™s morale up ðŸ™‚
