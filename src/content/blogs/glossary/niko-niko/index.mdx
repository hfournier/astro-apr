Niko-Niko calendars are used to track mood, energy, happiness, etc, but not everyone thinks that they’re a good idea. The good: a team that tracks how team members are feeling can start to deal with some challenges that affect them sooner. The bad: if checking mood or energy reveals problems that don’t get dealt with, it could breed cynicism; some people feel these questions are invasive; these measures may be measuring something outside of work.
