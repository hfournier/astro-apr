**Iterative and Incremental Development** is fancy language for working in cycles and always releasing a version of the product at the end of a cycle. In Scrum that cycle is called a Sprint and the increment is expected to have releasable quality. This is done as designed Scrum Teams produce releasable quality products at the end of every Sprint.
