Pull Requests are a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch to another. They emerged from the world of open source and are optimized for low-trust, low-communication environments.

__If worker busyness were the measure of software productivity, then pull requests would be well__ __suited to the task.__ But we know that’s not how quality and productivity are formed.

****Weaknesses to Pull Requests include:****

*   Typically only spot surface level problems, missing structural level issues.
*   Lead to a false sense of security and reduced sense of accountability
*   Increases the effort per developer as they carefully wordsmith feedback
*   Changes often require 2-3 rounds of feedback and change, which increases the time to production
*   Can erode culture by discouraging live interactions and conversations
*   Inherently ineffective and inefficient due to emphasis on minimizing human interaction
*   Back and forth interruptions slow both the code author and the reviewer
*   Delay the improvement process to the end instead of building it in from the beginning
*   Represent Work in Progress, and we know that increases cycle time and reduces throughput in the system

****What to do instead:****

*   Pair programming: active review that builds quality into the product from the start
*   Ensemble programming: collaborative development with an effective work-in-progress of one, eliminates need for post-facto reviews and rework
*   If pull requests must be used, reduce the size of the average change; prioritize finishing other people’s pull requests before doing your own work; prefer conversations over written feedback.
