Sometimes organizations form **Special Teams** assigned to tackle technical bugs or other challenges. Frequently, these special teams make the very problem that they’re meant to solve, worse.

Three quick reasons, among many:  
– other teams no longer feel responsible for dealing with the problem: defects; security; …

– special teams have an incentive to keep their problems around forever to justify their continued existance
