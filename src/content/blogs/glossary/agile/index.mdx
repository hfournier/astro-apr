**Agile** is a _mindset_ for doing work in a team environment that improves teamwork, professional performance, and adaptability. The Agile mindset is focused on adapting to changing customer needs while still delivering a high-quality product, and is defined by the values and principles in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

There is no single way to put the Agile mindset into practice, and numerous approaches have been developed. [**Scrum**](/glossary/scrum) is currently the worldâ€™s most popular approach.

Agile and Scrum are _not_ the same things.
