**The SCARF Model** of human behaviour is useful to understand how people respond to the world through the lenses of **S**tatus, **C**ertainty, **A**utonomy, **R**elatedness, and **F**airness. In our case, we focus on how the model explains behaviour of people in the world of Agile work.

The model is based on three major findings:

*   Social threats and rewards are treated with the same intensity as physical threats and rewards. _– Eisenberger, N. and Lieberman, M. (2009)_
*   Our ability to solve problems and make decisions is diminished when we’re in a threat state, and increases when in a reward state. _– Fredrickson, B. (2001)._
*   People are more easily placed into Threat than Reward, so in our work we need to minimize the things that create Threat. _– Baumeister, R., Bratslavsky, e., & Vohs, K. (2001)_
