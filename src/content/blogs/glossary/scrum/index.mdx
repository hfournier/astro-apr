**Scrum** is an _approach_ to applying the [Agile](/glossary/agile) mindset. Scrum is a way of organizing a team of people to deliver incremental parts or features of a product over a short, fixed time period. Scrum grew up in the world of software development, but it can be used anywhere that individuals need to collaborate as a team to deliver something of value to a customer.

Agile and Scrum are _not_ the same things.
