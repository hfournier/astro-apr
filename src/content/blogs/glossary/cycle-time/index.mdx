**Cycle Time** is the time it takes from the moment a team starts work on an item, until the moment value is delivered to the customer. It matters because the customer doesnâ€™t see something as complete until they have it in their hands and can use it. Many teams seem to think their work is complete when it meets Definition of Done and the Product Owner accepts the item. If you live in a world where features are delivered continuously then this is true. Many teams, however, live in a world where work happens downstream of the Development Team. Cycle time captures all of that and therefore challenges us to optimize the whole delivery process.
