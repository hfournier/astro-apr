[Eons ago](/blog/advantages-of-tdd.html) I promised a blog posting on TDD Adoptions strategy. Well, the posting grew and grew and grew (can you tell I read a lot of kids books?) and along the way morphed into something bigger. In the end, I decided this article needed a wider audience, so I published it on InfoQ. Hereâ€™s the blurb:

> [Making TDD Stick: Problems and Solutions for Adopters](https://www.infoq.com/articles/levison-TDD-adoption-strategy)
> 
> Teams in large organizations still struggle to adopt TDD. In this article Mark Levison shares problems he uncovered when he surveyed teams, and his own strategy to introduce TDD into an organization.
