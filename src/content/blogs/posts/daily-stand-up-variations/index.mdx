When trying to instill a new habit with a team I often find it useful to add a new question (or two) to the daily standup. Perhaps the team needs to pay more attention to Code Smells or Unit Testing. In those cases I ask team members to mention one thing they discovered (or better improved) related to that idea during standup everyday. My goal is to make spotting these issues a daily habit, even when they can’t be fixed right mentioning them raises awareness. Non-coders please reinterpret questions 4 and 5 in your own context.

As a reminder here are the updated questions:

1.  What did you **complete** yesterday?
2.  What do you **commit** to today?
3.  What are your impediments/obstacles?
4.  What Code Smell/Missing Unit Test/… did you spot yesterday?
5.  What improvement did you make to the code yesterday?

Even with the extra 2 questions teams should easily finish their stand-ups in fifteen minutes or less. I recommend that discussion be left until after the stand-up so people who’re not interested can sit down.

An additional trick I saw someone at my client us: pass the questions round on a piece of paper. You don’t need to read them but just holding the piece of paper is good reminder and helps people remain focused.

BTW I’ve been very quiet recently in part because I’m busy with client work and in part because just having become a CST I’ve decided to revamp my training materials yet again. More details coming soon.
