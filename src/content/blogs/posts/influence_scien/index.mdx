After my [introductory notes](/blog/influence_why_a.html), I’ve received a few inquires about more notes on Cialdini’s [Influence Science and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321011473/&tag=notesfromatoo-20). So I dug around on the web and offer up my discoveries.

The best of the bunch (much like my own) is a series in six parts starting on [Janin’s (sp?) blog happening-here](https://happening-here.blogspot.com/2006/01/surrounded-by-weapons-of-influence.html). _Update: Just discovered Marshall Soules class Media studies 205: Promotion, Persuasion and Propaganda. Fall 2006. (at Malaspina University College, Nanaimo BC). Marshall’s course also has an extensive summary._
