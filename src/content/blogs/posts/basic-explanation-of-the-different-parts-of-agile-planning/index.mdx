Agile Planning has many distinct phases and when you’re first learning it’s hard to keep track. This table is an attempt to simplify some of that. Note that release planning is split into two parts to make them distinct in practice. They’re normally just part of the same meeting, run on successive days.

For the sake of simplicity, I’m ignoring anything beyond release planning (e.g. strategic, roadmap, …), but you should definitely have some.
