Recently I had a conversation with a long time friend that made me realize that in my writing and conversation I often come across as a fanatic. Oppppsssss. Time for me to hit the big red reset button. I’m opinionated and passionate but I also believe that you can do good work even if your not push agile limits. There are two things that I’m dogmatic about:

1.  Quality – I can’t stand shit, especially shit code.
2.  Accuracy – I hate mis-information and will pounce on it even when I should know better.

In any case I thought it might help put my core beliefs on the table. If you are working in small achievable chunks and are **continuously improving** you are **Agile**. On the other hand you be doing all of the Scrum Practices (Short Iterations, Planning Meeting, Daily Standup, etc.) but are not making any ongoing changes, then you’re **not Agile**.
