	<p>
		<span
			>These courses are designed to provide hands-on experience with Scrum and a deep understanding
			of the Scrum Master role. Everyone adheres to the same learning objectives, so we cover
			similar topics. The Agile Pain Relief difference is that we focus on doing Scrum in the real
			world, not just in theory. As difficult questions come up on the fly in the workshop, we
			answer them. Far more importantly, we give you a plan so that when you return to the team
			after the workshop, you have a clear understanding of what’s next. We’ve created a safe place
			to learn and have designed the material to be playful. After you complete a training workshop,
			you might be afraid and unsure about where to go afterwards for answers? We have you covered,
			with a vibrant community of practitioners and monthly coaching sessions where people can join
			in and ask questions.</span>
	</p>
	<h3><b>Do Some Preparation</b></h3>
	<p>
		<span
			>Don’t worry, we provide the preparation material for you. We don’t expect you to scour the
			internet to find good descriptions of Scrum. By having you do a little bit of reading in
			advance of the training workshop, we can save a great deal of time discussing the basic
			mechanics and move onto deeper problems, which will equip you to handle Scrum challenges in
			real life.
		</span>
	</p>
	<h3><b>Pass an Exam</b></h3>
	<p>
		<span
			>After completing the CSM course, you’ll need to pass an exam to <a
				href="/what-is-scrum-master-certification"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener">get your Scrum Alliance Scrum Master certification</a
			>. The test typically includes multiple-choice questions about Scrum principles, roles,
			events, and artifacts. Remember, the exam is not just a test of knowledge but also an
			assessment of your understanding of Scrum and your ability to apply it. But with Mark’s unique
			training style, the vast majority of attendees pass easily on the first try.
		</span>
	</p>
	<h2><span>Practise The Scrum Principles That You Learned</span></h2>
	<h3><b>Focus on Your Team</b></h3>
	<p>
		<span
			>In Scrum, the focus is on the team, its dynamics, and its effectiveness. A Scrum Master is
			the team&#8217;s guide on the side, not a traditional manager. You act without authority, as
			their coach and mentor.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span
			>To play the Scrum Master role well, investing in your people skills is crucial. Learn how to
			effectively communicate, facilitate, listen, ask powerful questions, resolve conflicts, and
			create an environment where the team can be productive.</span>
	</p>
	<h3><b>Your Team’s Long-Term Health is More Important Than Its Velocity</b></h3>
	<p>
		<span
			>As a Scrum Master, you’ll be responsible for ensuring that the team follows Scrum principles
			and practices. However, it’s crucial to remember that the team’s long-term health and
			sustainability are more important than its short-term velocity. This means ensuring team
			members are not overworked, the quality of work is not compromised for speed, and the team
			continually improves its ways of working.</span>
	</p>
	<h2><span>How Long Does it Take to Become a Scrum Master?</span></h2>
	<p>
		<span
			>Becoming a Scrum Master doesn’t happen overnight. The time it takes depends on your current
			knowledge and experience with teams and Agile approaches. For some, it might take a few months
			of dedicated learning and practice. For others, it might take a year or more. Remember, it’s
			not just about gaining theoretical knowledge but also about applying it in real-world
			scenarios. The hardest part isn’t understanding the core mechanics of Scrum. It is knowing how
			to work well with the people on your team without use of power. You’re just there as their
			coach and guide on the side, not their overlord.</span>
	</p>
	<h2><span>Read Our Agile Blog and Glossary to Stay Current on Scrum Master Topics</span></h2>
	<p>
		<span
			>Continuing education is key to excelling as a Scrum Master. Stay updated with the latest
			trends, techniques, and best practices in the Agile world. Our blog is a great resource for
			this, offering a wealth of articles on various topics related to Scrum. We also have a
			glossary that can help clarify any unfamiliar terms you encounter.</span>
	</p>
	<h3><b>Participate in Our Community</b></h3>
	<p>
		<span
			>Becoming an active participant in Scrum and Agile communities can help you immensely in your
			journey. Community offers a platform to share knowledge, learn from others&#8217; experiences,
			and get advice when faced with challenges. When you attend our workshops you get invited to an
			exclusive community that also includes two other Certified Scrum Trainers, so you can benefit
			from a broad scope of experiences.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span
			>Becoming a Scrum Master is a journey of constant learning and improvement. Embrace the Agile
			mindset of iterative learning, and you’ll be well on your way to becoming an effective Scrum
			Master.</span>
	</p>
	<h2><span>Scrum vs. Agile</span></h2>
	<p>
		<span
			>It’s kind of confusing. Aren’t Scrum and Agile the same thing? No. Scrum is one of the
			original 7–8 frameworks that emerged in the mid ‘90s. Agile is the umbrella name for all of
			those frameworks. Scrum has a simple, clear set of rules which is seven pages long. Agile has
			only four Value statements and twelve Principles, and it doesn’t even occupy a whole page.
			Agile isn’t a methodology, it is far more of a mindset.</span>
