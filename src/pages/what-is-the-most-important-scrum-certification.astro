	<h2>What Is Scrum Certification?</h2>
	<p>
		Scrum certification is a highly sought-after credential acknowledging a person’s knowledge of
		Scrum principles and Agile methodologies. It’s a designation that demonstrates the
		characteristics of an effective Scrum Master and one’s understanding of the fundamentals of
		Scrum. It also shows a person’s ability to lead teams toward creating products and achieving
		goals with high efficiency and accountability.
	</p>
	<h2>Why Earn Scrum Certification?</h2>
	<p>
		Earning a Scrum certification is excellent for project managers and team leaders who want an
		edge on their resume, improve their day-to-day tasks, and open themselves up to more career
		opportunities. Here’s an overview of the benefits of getting certified in Scrum:
	</p>
	<h3>Proficiency Validation and Industry Recognition</h3>
	<p>
		Scrum certification proves one’s proficiency in Agile and Scrum concepts and substantiates an
		ability to put these into practice. A person with the credentials earns prestigious recognition
		in the industry, making them more valuable in the eyes of employers.
	</p>
	<h3>Elevated Project Efficacy</h3>
	<p>
		Scrum certification teaches one how to work with a team more effectively and efficiently. It
		teaches better organization, direction, collaboration, and problem-solving and strengthens a
		person’s risk assessment skills. These prevent bottlenecks and issues that could otherwise stall
		projects or waste time and resources.
	</p>
	<h3>Increased Career Opportunities</h3>
	<p>
		Scrum certification can increase job opportunities and open candidates to commensurate salary
		raises. It shows an enduring commitment to acquiring knowledge, which sustains a competitive
		edge in the job market.
	</p>
	<h2>Scrum Master Certification</h2>
	<p>
		Scrum Master certification is the entry-level recognition for Scrum professionals, and it’s
		often considered the most important credential to getting one’s foot in the door regarding the
		Agile methodology. That said, a step further can make a load of difference.
	</p>
	<p>
		Advanced Certified Scrum Master Training (A-CSM) from Agile Pain Relief builds on CSM and equips
		people with a stronger understanding and better practice of the Scrum framework. The program
		provides students with the foundation and support needed to drastically increase their
		effectiveness and efficiency in pushing teams toward achieving goals and obtaining
		milestones–all through a comprehensible, experience-backed, and practical educational approach.
	</p>
	<h2>How to Become Scrum-Certified</h2>
	<p>
		The first step to becoming Scrum-certified is to understand the fundamentals of Scrum,
		familiarizing oneself with the framework’s roles, events, and artifacts. To take this a step
		further, one should enroll in training, like Agile Pain Relief’s A-CSM training to gain a more
		in-depth know-how of the methodology, its values, and its practices, and how these apply to
		real-world cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		With this comes choosing the right certification. Multiple certifications are available catering
		to specific roles and skill levels, and it’s important to know which aligns with an individual’s
		career goals.
	</p>
	<p>
		After education and training, gaining hands-on experience through sample projects implementing
		Scrum practices is best. This will also work as a review for Scrum course exams, through which
		one can receive certification after passing.
