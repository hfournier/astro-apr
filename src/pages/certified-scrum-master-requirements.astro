		Are you about to step into the realm of Agile approaches and enhance your professional
		credentials as a Certified Scrum Master (CSM)? If so, you&#8217;re about to embark on a
		rewarding journey. In this article, we&#8217;ll outline the requirements and steps you need to
		achieve this widely recognized certification.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Scrum Alliance, the original and leading Agile certification body, facilitates the Certified
		ScrumMaster® certification. The certification is designed to ensure that you understand Scrum
		practices, values, and roles. More importantly, it also equips you to become a change agent in
		your organization, helping drive the shift toward Agile ways of working.
	</p>
	<p>Let&#8217;s demystify the path towards becoming a Certified Scrum Master:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h2>Attend a CSM Course</h2>
			<p>
				The first step towards earning the CSM certification is to attend a two-day training course
				led by our Certified Scrum Trainer (CST), Mark Levison. This course provides comprehensive
				insight into the Scrum framework. The training is interactive, blending theoretical
				instruction with practical exercises to ensure that you understand not only the
				&#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;why&#8217; of Scrum but also the &#8216;how&#8217;. <a
					href="/how-long-is-scrum-master-training"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener">How long is scrum master training?</a
				> Typically the formal CSM course happens over two days, but the practical training and learning
				is life-long.
			</p>
			<li>
				<h2>Understand Scrum</h2>
				<p>
					While attending the training course is mandatory, it&#8217;s equally important to spend
					some time beforehand familiarizing yourself with Scrum. Reviewing the official Scrum Guide
					and additional Scrum literature, participating in Scrum communities, or even observing
					Scrum practices in your current organization can provide valuable context and
					understanding.
				</p>
				<li>
					<h2>Pass the Scrum Master Certification Exam</h2>
					<p>
						After completing the course, you&#8217;ll need to pass the CSM exam. This online test
						consists of 50 multiple-choice questions, and you&#8217;ll need to score at least 74% to
						pass. The questions are rooted in the Scrum Guide and the material covered during your
						training. Please don’t stress about this exam &#8211; the hard part isn’t the exam, it’s
						doing Scrum in real life.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h2>Accept the Scrum Alliance License Agreement</h2>
						<p>
							Once you pass the exam, you&#8217;ll need to accept the Scrum Alliance&#8217;s license
							agreement to officially become a Certified Scrum Master. Following this, you&#8217;ll
							be listed on the Scrum Alliance website&#8217;s global database of CSM professionals.
						</p>
						<li>
							<h2>Maintain Your Scrum Master Certification</h2>
							<p>
								The CSM certification is valid for two years. To maintain it beyond this period,
								you&#8217;ll need to earn Scrum Education Units (SEUs) through ongoing education and
								professional development. We offer several free resources on this site to help you
								obtain your required SEUs.
							</p>
						</li>
						<p>
							It&#8217;s essential to note that the <a
								href="/certified-scrum-master-training-and-certification"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">certified scrum master training and certification</a
							> is about much more than the certificate itself. It&#8217;s about understanding and embracing
							the Scrum values and principles and applying them to drive effective teamwork and deliver
							high-value outputs. As a Certified Scrum Master, you&#8217;re not just a team facilitator,
							but a key player in fostering an Agile culture in your organization.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, becoming a certified scrum master can significantly enhance your
							professional standing. In a global market where Agile approaches are rapidly being
							adopted, having a Certified ScrumMaster® certification signals to employers your
							commitment to Agile values, your understanding of Scrum, and your ability to coach
							Scrum teams effectively. Furthermore, as a CSM, you join a global community of Scrum
							and Agile practitioners, offering countless opportunities for learning, networking,
							and professional growth.
