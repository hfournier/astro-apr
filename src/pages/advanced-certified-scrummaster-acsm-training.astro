	<span>Have you ever found yourself thinking:</span>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		My team keeps taking multiple sprints to deliver a working product feature. How can I get my
		team to be more effective without resorting to bribery or threats? Oh, and don’t even get me
		started on product quality issues.
	</li>
	<li>
		In our organization, stakeholders want everything, all at once. Even worse, when we ask
		clarifying questions, they just don’t answer. Since cattle prods are frowned on, what can I do?
	</li>
	<li>
		Some team members are expressing dissatisfaction with Scrum, and frequently skip Retrospectives
		claiming they’re boring and ineffective. How can I make them attend Scrum team events?
	</li>
	<li>
		Is there any way to convince stubborn executives and stakeholders to support adopting Scrum?
		Asking for a friend.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If any of these Scrum challenges sound familiar, we&#8217;ve got your back and will help you find
	the fix. A-CSM training is the solution.

<p>
	<strong>
		Any certified Scrum Trainer can help you get a CSM certificate that you can frame for your wall.
		But do they help you know how to work through the hard parts of Scrum and teach you the right
		skills to be effective?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Doing Scrum with your team in real life isn’t easy. We equip you with the tools, Agile foundations
	and principles, and support to make the difficult achievable, so you can do Scrum well.
</p>
<p>
	Using 20+ years of experience teaching Scrum and the science of learning, we infuse our Advanced
	Certified ScrumMaster training program with humor and wit to make the course fun and engaging.
	Plus, we back up our claims with hard evidence, so you can trust that you&#8217;re getting the
	real deal with your Advanced Scrum Master certification. As a Scrum course provider, we ensure
	that our online certification training program is a safe place for you to learn.
</p>
<p>
	<strong
		>This course ISN’T the same as other Advanced Certified ScrumMaster classes. Not by a long shot.
		Some notable course differences that should matter to you:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You won’t sit around for two long days listening to boring PowerPoint and lectures that you’ll
		forget after you leave the Advanced CSM certification. This Advanced Certified ScrumMaster
		course is an immersive learning experience, self-paced so you have time to actually practice the
		skills that you learn and get follow-up support as needed. Instead of cheap, fast-food learning
		that leaves you hungry soon after, it’s a relaxed-paced, fine dining, nutritional experience for
		your ScrumMaster mind that leaves you full AND sends you home with the recipes so you can
		recreate it on your own. (Did we take that metaphor too far? Fair enough, but you get the
		point.)
	</li>
	<li>
		The advanced certification course material is designed to help you start the improvement with
		your real team, right now. Since we have regular Scrum Master coaching calls, when you get stuck
		you’re not left on your own.
	</li>
	<li>
		Our A-CSM experience. I’ve been doing/coaching/teaching Scrum since 2001 – longer than most
		people have known that it even exists. My co-trainers, Bernie and Anil, add their Scrum
		extensive experience to the mix, and you get access and support from all three of us. Why listen
		to one person’s opinion on A-CSM topics, when you can benefit from a hearty stew of collective
		expertise and experience to find something that hits the spot for you? (Okay, we’ll quit with
		the food analogies.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Why rely on opinions at all? Seems risky. We share our real life Scrum experiences, but we also
		back up what we say with published research and evidence. If you’re comparing to other A-CSM
		certification courses, see if they offer anything like that!
	</li>
	<li>
		Sure, we still include all the same stuff that other A-CSM courses include for certification,
		but we’d die if we had to slog through that, over and over again, so we make sure the course is
		at least fun and interesting, for all involved.
	</li>
</ul>

	<p></p>
</div>
<p>
	Move beyond being a ScrumMaster who is just trying to figure out how to go through the motions and
	hopefully be effective with your team. Invest in a deeper understanding by learning and practicing
	new skills, principles, and tools that will help you confidently sell scrum to leadership and
	management, work with stakeholders to resolve impediments, and coach the product owner to create
	quality products. The A-CSM certification course can help you accomplish all your Scrum goals.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Team challenges where your co-participants become your accountability partners. Easier to stay
		on track and motivated with product development.
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-paced program allows us to deliver far more material than a traditional in-person workshop
		since we’re not constrained by two days of learning time.
	</li>
	<li>
		We host regular Scrum Master coaching calls, so challenging problems can be worked through live
		with your peer group.
	</li>
	<li>
		Our active Scrum community forum is a safe place to ask follow-up questions and clarify course
		material.
	</li>
	<li>
		Long after you have earned the Advanced Certified Scrum Master certification (A-CSM), you will
		have access to the forum, course materials, and additional valuable resources.
	</li>
	<li>
		Hands-on practice and useful help. You don’t need any more boring Scrum theory. You need
		something that you can sink your teeth into and see immediate results. Learn on-the-job
		application of key Scrum concepts, skills, principles, and practical solutions for difficult,
		real-life scenarios that you can apply the next day.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Advanced Certified ScrumMaster</h2>
<h3>What is an advanced certified Scrum Master?</h3>
<p>
	A ScrumMaster is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum principles and values are understood and
	practiced within the Scrum Team and their organization as a whole. They facilitate Scrum events,
	and help to identify and eliminate impediments. Their role is to also safeguard the team from
	external challenges, and coach the Scrum team by encouraging continuous improvement and
	collaboration. And, finally, a Scrum Master facilitates effective communication between Scrum
	Developers, Product Owners, stakeholder, management, and all involved.
</p>
<p>
	An Advanced Certified ScrumMaster is one who has fulfilled the <a
		href="/a-csm-certification-requirements-requirements-for-advanced-certified-scrum-masters"
		title="A-CSM Certification Requirements: Requirements for Advanced Certified Scrum Masters"
		rel="noopener"
		target="_blank">A-CSM Certification Requirements</a
	>, and has completed Scrum Alliance Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training from an accredited
	Certified Scrum Trainer to deepen their understanding of the Scrum Master role and their
	effectiveness with their team.
</p>
<h3>Is Advanced certified Scrum Master worth it?</h3>
<p>
	If you or your organization are struggling to implement Scrum effectively, or you are not seeing
	the results you expected or hoped for with the adoption of Agile and Scrum, Advanced Certified
	ScrumMaster training will be a valuable investment. By having a deeper understanding of the how
	and why of Scrum, and not just the what, an Advanced Certified Scrum Master will be able to help
	keep your organization on track, reduce conflicts and challenges, and coach your Scrum team to
	higher performance and effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
	On a more personal level, Scrum Masters with Advanced Certified ScrumMaster (A-CSM) certification
	typically have significantly better employment opportunities and higher wage ranges.
</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Scrum Master and advanced Scrum Master?</h3>
<p>
	Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) certification® is the first step in the Scrum Alliance® Learning
	Journey: Scrum Master Track. The initial CSM certification training teaches the basics of the
	Scrum framework and Agile methodology, but it is limited in scope and does not dig deep into
	practical methods to apply the principles and be effective in the Scrum Master role.
</p>
<p>
	Advanced Certified ScrumMaster (A-CSM) certification® is the second step in the Scrum Master
	Track. (Certified Scrum Professional® – ScrumMaster (CSP – SM) is the third step.) A-CSMs learn
	and develop broader skills and experience with facilitation, conflict resolution, and coaching
	teams to greater improvement and performance. Lean software development, collaboration,
	cross-skilling, and scaling Scrum in organizations, as well as overall organization change, are
	just some of the areas that an Advanced Scrum Master has more knowledge and tools to help their
	team.
</p>
<h3>How much does an advanced certified Scrum Master earn?</h3>
<p>
	Indeed.com lists the average salary of an Advanced Certified Scrum Master in the ballpark of
	$110,000 and $130,000 annually*, which works out to around $60 per hour on average. Reportedly,
	Canadian A-CSMs receive slightly higher earnings than their American counterparts. <strong
		><em
			>*As of late 2023 there are only a few thousand Advanced Certified Scrum Masters world-wide. I
			would make the guess that data found in a few other sources was generated by an LLM and so has
			no basis in fact.</em
		></strong>
</p>
<h3>What is the highest level of Scrum Master?</h3>
<p>
	Certified Scrum Professional® – ScrumMaster (CSP – SM) is currently the highest level of Scrum
	Master certification offered by the Scrum Alliance®, the globally-recognized licensing body for
	Scrum. After becoming a CSP-SM, the path continues to Certified Team Coach (CTC) and Certified
	Enterprise Coach (CEC).
