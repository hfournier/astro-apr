		You’ve probably heard the words Agile and Scrum a lot in your professional work life, often
		interchangeably, and sometimes in reference to things that are neither Agile nor Scrum.
		Confusing, right?

		reading over video, there is a <a href="/the-story-of-a-sprint" rel="noopener" target="_blank"

	<h2>What Is Agile?</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="/glossary/agile"><strong>Agile</strong></a> is a <em>mindset</em> for doing work in a team
		environment that improves teamwork, professional performance, and adaptability. The Agile mindset
		is focused on adapting to changing customer needs while still delivering a high-quality product,
		and is defined by the values and principles in the <a
			href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile Manifesto</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no single way to put the Agile mindset into practice, and numerous approaches have been
		developed. <strong>Scrum</strong> is currently the world’s most popular approach.
	</p>
	<h2>So, Wait, Agile Isn’t Scrum?</h2>
	<p>
		As you might guess from the different titles here, Agile and Scrum are <em>not</em> the same things.
		<a href="/glossary/scrum"><strong>Scrum</strong></a> is an <em>approach</em> to applying the Agile
		mindset. It provides a lightweight framework to build a product in a way that delivers value to the
		customer quickly and incrementally, and can adapt if needs change or priorities shift, so you don’t
		spend months building something only to hand it over and it’s already outdated or not what they wanted
		any more. Scrum grew up in the world of software development, but it can be used anywhere that individuals
		need to collaborate as a team to deliver something of value to a customer.
	</p>
	<h2>Why Choose the Scrum Approach?</h2>
	<p>
		Whole essays have been written on this. <a
			href="/blog"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark discusses in more detail in his blog</a
		>, but the simplified answer is because it works. Scrum encourages the team to improve on two
		levels at the same time. First on the product level, by gaining feedback from stakeholders on
		what is wanted. Second, collecting feedback about the team’s process and the way they work
		together. The first level allows us to get iteratively closer to the product the customer needs,
		while the second helps the team grow their skills and teamwork, and focus on delivering quality.
		Combined, these are very effective toward core Agile goals.

	<h2>Scrum Terminology</h2>
	<p>
		Scrum has a lot of unique terminology and concepts. Here are the main ones you’ll often hear
		mentioned.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/sprint">Sprint</a></h3>
	<p>
		A fixed period, ranging from one week to one month in length, during which the Scrum Team works
		to meet specific customer needs. As one Sprint ends, the next Sprint begins. The purpose of
		defining the work period is that it enables the Team to focus on a limited and prioritized
		number of features, and it encourages the delivery of at least some completed work to the
		customer each Sprint.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/scrum-team">Scrum Team</a></h3>
	<p>All of the people needed to get the product built and into the customer’s hands:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="/glossary/scrummaster-role" title="ScrumMaster">ScrumMaster</a>, who helps the team
			grow capacity to deliver value
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="/glossary/product-owner-role" title="Product Owner">Product Owner</a>, who manages
			the vision for what they will be creating
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="/glossary/developers" title="Developers">Developers</a>, who are the cross-functional
			group of people who will build the Product (e.g. in software development this group usually
			includes programmers, business analysts, quality assurance, user experience and more).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/product-backlog">Product Backlog</a></h3>
	<p>
		An ordered list of all the things the Product Owner would like to see the Team work on in the
		foreseeable future. These items are called Product Backlog Items (PBIs).
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/user-story">User Story</a>*</h3>
	<p>
		A tool used to provoke and summarize a conversation, between the Team and their Product Owner,
		for a better understanding of an item on the Product Backlog. The User Story provides context
		regarding who a Product Backlog Item is being developed for and why it is of value. <em
			>*It’s important to note that this isn’t part of Scrum per se, but is a tool that grew up
			beside Scrum and is often used in conjunction. User Stories can be helpful but aren’t required
			as part of the practice of Scrum.</em>
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/sprint-planning">Sprint Planning</a></h3>
	<p>
		An event at the beginning of a Sprint where the Team plans the items they can complete in the
		next Sprint. They also craft a goal to act as a focus for their work.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a></h3>
	<p>
		A single objective shared by the Team that describes the purpose of the Sprint and ensures that
		everyone moves in the same direction. A simply-stated goal makes it easier to prioritize Product
		Backlog Items, assess whether tests and feedback are relevant to the goal, and summarize the
		work currently being done when asked by stakeholders.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/product-backlog-refinement">Product Backlog Refinement</a></h3>
	<p>
		A session during which the Scrum Team (Developers, Product Owner, ScrumMaster) prepare the
		Product Backlog for the next few sprints. New Product Backlog Items (PBIs) are added for new
		needs to be considered. PBIs that are too large to be worked on in a single Sprint are broken
		down into smaller items. Estimates are made as to how much time each PBI will require to
		complete. The Product Owner makes prioritization decisions about PBIs, sharing with the Team
		their reasoning.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/sprint-backlog">Sprint Backlog</a></h3>
	<p>The list of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) the Team has committed to for the next Sprint.</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/daily-scrum">Daily Scrum</a></h3>
	<p>
		The daily meeting where the Scrum Team get ready to collaborate for the day, and check if
		they’re still on track to complete their goal forecast by the end of the Sprint.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/definition-of-done">Definition of Done</a></h3>
	<p>
		The official checklist that Scrum Teams maintain of the qualities they intend their work to
		achieve. It helps the team assess whether their work is truly completed and deliverable to the
		client as having added value. It also helps them in Sprint Planning by reminding them of the
		quality they have committed to achieving, ensuring they only commit to PBIs they can get to
		truly “Done.”
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/sprint-review">Sprint Review</a></h3>
	<p>
		An event at the end of the Sprint where the Scrum Team review the completed work with
		stakeholders. Stakeholders provide feedback on the completed work and ideas for product
		improvements. The Product Backlog will get updated during future refinement to reflect what
		everyone learned.
	</p>
	<h3><a href="/glossary/sprint-retrospective">Sprint Retrospective</a></h3>
	<p>
		An event at the end of the Sprint where the Scrum Team reflects on all that happened in that
		period, with the intention to improve how they work in the next Sprint.
	</p>

		That is Agile and Scrum forced into a ridiculously small nutshell. You can spend years learning
		and understanding the many nuances, and how to get the greatest benefits out of them. If you’d
		like to take the first step and build a solid foundational understanding of the <em>how</em> and
		<em>why</em> of Scrum, and not just the <em>what</em> that you can learn from reading summary pages
		like this, join us in our training workshops. You will actually practice Scrum and learn how to make
		it work for you in the real world, rather than just in theory.

		<h3>
			<a
				href="/what-is-scrum-used-for"
				title="What is Scrum Used For?"
				rel="noopener"
				target="_blank">What is Scrum used for?</a>
		</h3>
		<h3>What is considered the definition of Scrum?</h3>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank"
				><em>Scrum Guide</em></a
			> is considered the definition of Scrum and serves as the foundational document for understanding
			Scrum.
		</p>
		<h3>How does Scrum help teams deliver value incrementally?</h3>
		<p>
			Scrum is iterative and incremental. As mentioned above, Scrum teams work in short repeated
			cycles called Sprints. That’s the iterative part. The incremental part is that at the end of
			every Sprint the team release a new version of the product they’re working on. So the work is
			incremental, each Sprint building on the previous Sprint’s work.
		</p>
		<h3>What is the difference between Scrum and Professional Scrum?</h3>
		<p>
			Don’t let subjective titles on the internet confuse you. There is a <strong>huge</strong> difference
			between Scrum that is practiced on a professional level, and the label on the certification offered
			by Scrum.org, a for-profit organization.
		</p>
		<h4>Certification</h4>
		<p>
			The most recognized Scrum certification is Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM®), with the
			Professional Scrum Master ™ (PSM ™) in second place. PSM I is an exam only and there is no
			formal learning requirement. CSM requires that you learn and practice with a Certified Scrum
			Trainer, who has undergone a rigorous, multi-year process to qualify. CSM certification
			requires comprehension of Scrum principles and the demonstration of the practices, which is in
			contrast to the PSM exam that tests your memory of theory.
		</p>
		<h4>Practice</h4>
		<p>
			Let’s ignore the Professional Scrum certification label, and acknowledge that there is a
			difference between practicing Scrum by going through the motions as you understand them, and
			practicing Scrum on a professional, effective level. Scrum done wrong can do a lot of harm.
			Misconceptions about how it fosters micromanagement and excessive…

		<h3>Where can I find more resources to learn about Scrum?</h3>

			On this page we have forced Agile and Scrum into a ridiculously small nutshell to provide a
			basic explanation. You can spend years learning and understanding the many nuances, and how to
