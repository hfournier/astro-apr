		You can also access material for a corresponding <a
			href="/blog/welcome-to-the-high-performance-teams-game.html">High-Performance Teams Game</a
		>. The game was developed to help teams see the effects of choices/tradeoffs on productivity and
		team cohesion. Rounds represent Sprints, and a roll of the dice may have things go smoothly,
		or&#8230; not so much.

		We hope you will feel free to <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
