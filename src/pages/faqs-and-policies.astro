	<p>
		We believe strongly in transparency, information, and helping with challenges as much as we can.
		If you have a question or concern that isn&#8217;t addressed below, please be sure to <a
			href="/contact-us">contact us</a
		> and let us know.
	</p>
	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h4>Does the course registration fee include exam fee and membership?</h4>
	<p>
		Yes, it includes any applicable exam fees (currently only CSM has an exam) and two years of
		ScrumAlliance membership.
	</p>
	<h4>What will we need for the in-person Scrum training?</h4>
	<p>
		Just yourself and an open mind. And maybe your favourite pen, but we&#8217;ll also have lots of
		those. Workbooks will be provided to you in class but they&#8217;re more for later reference and
		you won&#8217;t be using them much. We&#8217;ll have shorts breaks with healthy snacks and
		coffee/tea. You&#8217;re on your own for lunch.
	</p>
	<h4>What will we need for the online Scrum training?</h4>
	<p>
		An internet connection and computer system that can handle video conferencing and multiple
		applications at once (e.g. Google Docs, Mural, Zoom), a webcam and microphone (your
		computer&#8217;s built-in mic is fine), and a browser that is *not* I.E. (Chrome and
		Chrome-based browsers, Firefox, Safari should be fine.)
	</p>
	<h4>Will a virtual course still qualify for certification?</h4>
	<p>
		Yes. It will still have Certified Scrum Trainer Mark Levison as the instructor and it will still
		be live and interactive, and cover all the curriculum that the Scrum Alliance requires for
		certification. In general, the training won’t be a lot different than our in-class workshops,
		except that you’ll have to make your own coffee.
	</p>
	<h4><strong>What is the best course for me?</strong></h4>
	<p>
		If you&#8217;re struggling to decide whether to take the ScrumMaster or Product Owner training, <a
			title="Choose the Right Scrum Training for Your Needs"
			href="/choose-the-right-scrum-training-for-your-needs">this might help</a
		>. It&#8217;s not unusual for people to take both CSM and CSPO training to have a broader, and
		more effective, understanding of both roles.
	</p>

	<h2>Cancellation &amp; Refund Requests</h2>
	<p>
		If request for registration cancellation is received at least 10 business days prior to course
		start date, 100% of the registration will be refunded. Registration is non-refundable less than
		10 business days prior to course start. <strong
			>If you absolutely can no longer attend, we strongly encourage you to transfer your
			registration rather than cancel, as outlined below.</strong>
	</p>
	<h4>Registration Transfers</h4>
	<p>
		Transferring a registration to a different person for the same course date can be done at any
		time, at no additional cost. Transferring a registration to an alternate course date can be done
		up to 10 business days prior to the start date of the original course. Requests received less
		than 10 business days prior are not possible. We allow one change in date for free; additional
		changes will incur a 20% fee.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Attendance</h2>
	<p>
		If you do not attend the course and do not notify us in advance to discuss, registration is
		non-refundable and non-transferable. In the case of unforeseeable events such as medical
		emergencies, please contact us and provide as much detail and documentation as possible, and we
		will work together to find an appropriate solution.
	</p>
	<h2>Course location to be confirmed and may be subject to change</h2>
	<p>
		We make every effort to guarantee our course dates, however some things are beyond our control.
		In the event that we are forced to cancel a course for reasons including, but not limited to,
		trainer illness or weather-restricted travel, we will offer your choice of full refund or credit
		toward a future course.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>
		Basically, we don&#8217;t share or use your personal information for any nefarious purposes and
		we hate spam with a passion so we don&#8217;t do that either. You can read our much more <a
			href="/privacy-policy">detailed Privacy Policy here</a
		>.
