	<p>
		Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO®) certification is a valuable credential for individuals
		looking to enhance their career prospects in the field of Agile and Scrum. As with many
		professional certificates, a common question asked is &#8220;Does CSPO certification expire, and
		if so, what can you do to maintain it?&#8221; Short answer: yes it expires, and we’ll tell you
		in this article <a href="/how-to-renew-cspo-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>how to renew your CSPO certification</a
		>.
	</p>
	<h2>CSPO Certification Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Before diving into the expiration aspect, let&#8217;s briefly understand what CSPO certification
		entails. A Certified Scrum Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product
		by maintaining and prioritizing the product backlog. They work closely with the Scrum Team and
		stakeholders to ensure the product&#8217;s success through a clear product vision and alignment.
		The CSPO certification is a global recognition of your understanding of these responsibilities
		and the shared language and understanding of Agile principles.
	</p>
	<h2>CSPO Certification Duration</h2>
	<p>
		To obtain your official Scrum Alliance® CSPO certification, attend our Certified Scrum Product
		Owner training led by Certified Scrum trainer Mark Levison. It provides participants with
		in-depth insights into the nuances of the role and offers practical guidance on how to
		effectively fulfill the responsibilities of a Product Owner. During the training, participants
		engage in interactive discussions, group activities, simulations, and case studies that mimic
		real-world scenarios. This immersive approach allows participants to apply theoretical knowledge
		to practical situations, so they learn how to make informed decisions and navigate challenges as
		a Product Owner.
	</p>
	<p>
		After earning your CSPO certification it will be valid for a period of two years, and these
		first two years of Scrum Alliance membership is included in the training cost. After that, you
		will need to pay a small fee to renew your CSPO certification with the Scrum Alliance. The CSPO
		certification process is not just about acquiring a credential, it&#8217;s about personal and
		professional growth, so continuous learning is also a Scrum Alliance requirement of
		certification renewal.
	</p>
	<h2>Continuous Scrum Learning</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>Certified Scrum Product Owners</a
		> are required to earn Scrum Education Units (SEUs) over a two-year period to maintain their certification.
		These SEUs can be earned through various educational activities, and we offer several free resources
		on our website.
	</p>
