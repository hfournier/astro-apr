			Ownership within the broader context.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provides a deep understanding of the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; of Scrum, not
			just the &#8220;what.&#8221;
		</li>
		<li>Equips you with the ability to design retrospectives that help teams tackle challenges.</li>
		<li>
			Teaches coaching techniques for guiding your team through obstacles and coaching your Product
			Owner.

				rel="noopener">Product Ownership</a
			>.
		</li>
		<li>Emphasizes collaboration with your development team.</li>
		<li>Teaches you how to create an effective vision and strategy.</li>

		<li>Covers the art of breaking large User Stories into manageable pieces.</li>
		<li>Emphasizes delivering a usable product during each sprint.</li>
		<li>
			Suitable for individuals interested in understanding how to build, manage, and maintain an
			effective product backlog, or those looking to work closely with the Product Owner (e.g.,
			ScrumMasters, Business Analysts).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Who Could Benefit from CSPO Training:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Product Owners</li>
		<li>Scrum Masters</li>
		<li>Business Analysts</li>
		<li>Product Managers</li>
