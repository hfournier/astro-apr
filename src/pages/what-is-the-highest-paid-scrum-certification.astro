	<p>
		Learning how to be an effective Scrum Master typically involved formal certification training.
		The first level, Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification demonstrates your commitment to
		learning how to effectively apply the Scrum framework and Agile principles, and perform the
		Scrum Master role specifically.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because there are different levels of Scrum certification, it’s important to understand what
		each level of certification offers so you can decide which is the most important Scrum
		certification you want to achieve for your personal career goals.
	</p>
	<p>
		Aim for the <a
			href="/what-is-the-highest-level-of-scrum-master-certification"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">highest level of Scrum Master certification</a
		> possible to give yourself access to greater learning and understanding, as well as career opportunities.
		Each Scrum certification demonstrates to potential employers your commitment to developing skills
		and experience to handle the most complex projects and, as such, Scrum certifications typically also
		improve your earnings.
	</p>
	<h2>How Scrum Certification Can Boost Your Earnings</h2>
	<p>
		As a Certified Scrum Master, your salary can be higher than that of other professionals who
		aren’t certified because you will have gone through the rigorous training and testing required
		to become certified. Each subsequent level of certification deepens your understanding and
		expands your knowledge and skillset, helping you to stand out and be more sought after by
		organizations looking to transition to, or deepen existing, Agile practices.
	</p>
	<p>
		For instance, if you have an <a
			href="/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">advanced certified Scrum Master (A-CSM) certification</a
		>, your earning potential increases significantly because you have greater demonstrable skills
		in the Scrum framework and Agile methodology that most prestigious organizations are searching
		for.
	</p>
	<p>
		Scrum certification will give you access to better employment opportunities as many companies
		worldwide are searching for certified Scrum Masters and Scrum Product Owners. Although it’s not
		always mandatory that every Scrum Master hold a Scrum certification, many companies require you
		to be certified for you to hold specific positions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Advanced Certified Scrum Master certification will give you a competitive advantage in the
		global job market because there are very few people who hold this certification. (As of late
		2023 there are only a few thousand Advanced Certified Scrum Masters world-wide.) There are even
		fewer Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Masters® (CSP-SM®), as that is currently the highest
		level of Scrum Master specific certification. Obviously the more in demand the skills are, and
		the fewer people who hold the accreditation, results in the highest-paid Scrum certification.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides the financial benefits of Scrum certification, you’ll also enjoy more job satisfaction.
		Your ability to successfully implement the Scrum framework and promote teamwork, innovation, and
		ingenuity will bring you a great sense of fulfillment.
	</p>
	<h2>Make Educated Decisions About Your Career</h2>
	<p>
		It’s up to you to decide how far you want to go in your career as a team leader. To be a top
		earner, go for the highest Scrum certification possible from the most qualified and experienced
		Agile and Scrum trainer you can find. Certified Scrum Trainer Mark Levison at Agile Pain Relief
		would love to help you with your Scrum Master career goals. We can provide an extensive list of
		glowing testimonials and professional achievements to help give you confidence when choosing him
