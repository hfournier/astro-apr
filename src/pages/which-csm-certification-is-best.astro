		There are over 200 Certified Scrum Trainers licensed by the ScrumAlliance, worldwide, to offer
		Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) certification training. So why should you choose to get your scrum
		master certification with us?
	</p>
	<h2>Why Scrum Master Certification?</h2>
	<p>
		Before diving into why AgilePainRelief is an excellent choice for your Scrum training needs,
		it&#8217;s crucial to understand why the scrum master certification itself is significant.
		Certified ScrumMaster®, a globally recognized certification from the Scrum Alliance, empowers
		you with an in-depth understanding of Scrum principles and practices and equips you with the
		skills to efficiently fulfill the role of a Scrum Master.
	</p>
	<h2>Mark Levison and AgilePainRelief</h2>
	<p>
		Mark Levison is a prominent name in the Scrum training industry as a long-time Certified Scrum
		Trainer® (CST®), with over twenty years of Scrum experience and more than a decade as a
		respected Scrum and Agile educator. Mark is a Scrum pioneer in Canada, and his expertise lies in
		his rich industry experience, which extends to software development, management, and coaching
		teams in nearly every environment you can imagine. Mark has put great study and focus into
		understanding how people really learn, and incorporating that into the training he offers so
		it’s not only valuable, but also fun.
	</p>
	<h2>Quality Scrum Training</h2>
	<p>
		The quality of the Scrum training provided is incredibly important when choosing a certification
		course, especially since you are <a
			href="/how-long-is-scrum-master-training"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">investing precious time and money into it</a
		>. This is where AgilePainRelief truly shines. Our workshops are designed to be immersive and
		engaging, promoting a safe and holistic learning experience. Rather than relying purely on
		theoretical aspects, the training delves into real-world applications, equipping attendees with
		practical tools and techniques to effectively navigate the Agile and Scrum landscape, and
		address challenges that Scrum Masters will actually encounter (for e.g. <a
			href="/when-many-scrum-teams-are-working-on-the-same-product"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">when many Scrum teams are working on the same product</a
		>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Mark Levison brings in his vast experience to deliver relatable insights, personal anecdotes,
		and real-world case studies to illuminate Scrum principles and practices. His dynamic,
		interactive approach ensures attendees are not just passive listeners but active participants in
		the learning process.
	</p>
	<h2>Small Class Size</h2>
	<p>
		Another distinct feature of AgilePainRelief&#8217;s Certified ScrumMaster training is the
		commitment to maintaining small class sizes. This emphasis on a low student-teacher ratio
		ensures every course attendee receives personalized attention, thereby enhancing their learning
		experience. Smaller class sizes also fosters a more collaborative learning environment,
		facilitating open discussions, group activities, and role-play simulations.
	</p>
	<h2>Continuous Learning and Support</h2>
	<p>
		With AgilePainRelief, the learning journey doesn&#8217;t stop after the certified scrum master
		certification. The scrum master workshop equips you with a foundation of knowledge that can be
		built upon through continuous learning and experience. To support this, AgilePainRelief offers
		access to additional resources and learning materials post-workshop, ensuring that your growth
		as a Certified Scrum Master doesn&#8217;t stagnate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, Mark Levison has created an extensive network of alumni, a community that you
		become part of upon completing the certified scrum master training. This network is invaluable
		for ongoing support, learning, and career advancement opportunities.
