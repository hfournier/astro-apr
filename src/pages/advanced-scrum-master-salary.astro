	<p>
		As a Scrum Master, you’re responsible for making sure that Scrum functions effectively in your
		organization, which means helping the Scrum team achieve overall success with a project. You’re
		expected to work with the Developers and Scrum Product Owner to make sure that Product Backlog
		Items are successfully completed within the agreed Sprint, and value is delivered to the
		customer.
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of your role, you’re also required to facilitate discussions and help resolve conflicts
		and obstacles, which is where Advanced Scrum Master training really kicks in and your experience
		as the teams coach is highly valued.
	</p>
	<p>
		To perform these roles effectively and deliver the highest value, you need the Scrum Master
		skills that are best developed with our Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training in Scrum tactics
		and the Agile mindset, and even Lean Software Development methodology. Taking advanced Scrum
		Master training to become an Advanced Certified Scrum Master (<a

			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">A-CSM</a
		>) not only improves your skills and understanding of the Scrum framework and Agile principles,
		but also improves your chances of advancing in your career and earning a better salary.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many people who are interested in acquiring the A-CSM certification want to know if <a
			href="/advanced-certified-scrum-masters-versus-certified-scrum-masters"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">advanced Scrum Master certification is worth it</a
		>, <a href="/a-csm-certification-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>how much A-CSM certification costs</a
		>, and how much an advanced Scrum Master earns. Let’s dive in!
	</p>
	<h2>Earning Potential for ACSMs</h2>
	<p>
		An A-CSM professional has gone one step beyond a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) in the Scrum
		Alliance® Scrum Master track because they’ve completed advanced training in Scrum and the Agile
		methodology to earn the much-coveted advanced A-CSM certification. Consequently, the typical
		salary of an A-CSM is higher than that of a CSM.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em
			><strong
				>* As of late 2023 there are only a few thousand Advanced Certified ScrumMasters world-wide,
				so any discussion about salary data should be viewed with that understanding carefully in
				mind.
			</strong>
		</em>According to Indeed.com, the average annual salary of an Advanced Certified ScrumMaster is
		roughly between $110,000 and $130,000 (in the ballpark of $60 per hour on average), with
		slightly higher earnings in Canada versus the United States (late 2023 figures).
	</p>
	<h2>What Determines How Much an A-CSM Should Earn?</h2>
	<p>
		The total earnings for an A-CSM are based on several key factors. Understanding these factors
		will help you estimate how much you’re likely to earn after securing your certification.
	</p>
	<h3>Industry</h3>
	<p>
		The industry you work in will determine how much you earn. The IT, finance, and software
		development industries tend to pay their Scrum Masters handsomely. Glassdoor.com reports that
		Thomson Reuters pays its Scrum Masters an average annual salary of a little over $100,000 and
		J.P. Morgan pays slightly under $100K (late 2023).
	</p>
	<h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
	<p>
		A-CSMs have advanced skills and experience that enable them to facilitate and coach teams
		through more challenging problems. This puts their salaries higher than that of CSMs.
	</p>
	<h2>Take Your Scrum Master Career to the Next Level</h2>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that a well-paying Advanced Scrum Master role also requires that you have solid
		nontechnical skills in leadership, conflict resolution, facilitation, continuous improvement,
		and transparency. If you’re interested in advancing your career and learning new skills that
		will benefit your team and organization, consider our Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training.
