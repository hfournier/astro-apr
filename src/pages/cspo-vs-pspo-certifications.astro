	<p>
		Certified Scrum Product Owner training® (CSPO) and Professional Scrum Product Owner™ (PSPO)
		are two popular certifications for individuals who play the role of a Product Owner in Scrum
		teams. The most recognized Scrum certification is Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO), with
		Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) in second place. They are offered by different
		organizations and have significant differences:
	</p>
	<h2>Scrum Certifying Body:</h2>
	<p>
		&#8211; <a href="/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>CSPO certification</a
		> is offered by the Scrum Alliance, a non-profit organization focused on promoting Scrum and Agile
		practices. The Scrum Alliance is the original Scrum certifying body, founded in 2001. CSPO certification
		focuses on providing an understanding of the role of the Product Owner, and how to effectively apply
		Scrum in real life, including creating and managing a Product Backlog, defining a product vision,
		collaborating with stakeholders, and prioritizing work items to help the Development Team deliver
		effectively. CSPO workshops must be run by a Certified Scrum Trainer, and qualifying to be a trainer
		is a rigorous, multi-year process. Product Owner certification requires that a student actively participates
		in the training and demonstrates a high comprehension of the material.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8211; PSPO certification is offered by Scrum.org, a for-profit organization that provides
		Scrum training and certification. They were founded in 2010, nine years after the founding of
		the Scrum Alliance. Certification requires a passing grade on an exam that tests your ability to
		read and memorize Scrum theory.
	</p>
	<h2>Product Owner Curriculum and Training:</h2>
	<p>
		&#8211; The CSPO certification involves at least 14 hours of training by a Certified Scrum
		Trainer (CST). The course covers essential Scrum concepts for the Product Owner&#8217;s role and
		responsibilities within a Scrum team. The journey toward becoming a CSPO doesn&#8217;t end with
		certification. With our Certified Scrum Product Owner training, you gain access to an ongoing
		support system that includes a supportive growing community of practitioners just like you,
		working through problems in the real world. We also supply with you with a comprehensive supply
		of resources for your continued learning.
	</p>
	<p>&#8211; The PSPO I certification is a certification exam online without any training.</p>
	<h2>Product Owner Certification Renewal:</h2>
	<p>
		&#8211; The Scrum Alliance requires CSPO certificate holders to renew their certification every
		two years by earning Scrum Education Units (SEUs) and paying a renewal fee. SEUs demonstrate the
		commitment to the core Scrum and Agile principles of continuous learning and improvement. We
		provide several free resources on this website to earn SEUs as well as to grow your skills and
		understanding of the Scrum Product Owner role.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8211; Scrum.org does not require PSPO certificate holders to renew their certification. Once
		you achieve a PSPO certification, it is valid for life.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both CSPO and PSPO certifications focus on the Product Owner role in Scrum, but they are offered
		by different organizations and have differences in training quality and comprehension
		requirements. The choice between CSPO and PSPO may depend on your personal preferences, the
		availability of training in your area, and your specific career goals and needs. It&#8217;s
		essential to research both options thoroughly before deciding which certification is right for
		you.
