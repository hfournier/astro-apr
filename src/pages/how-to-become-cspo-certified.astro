	<p>
		Becoming a <a href="/certified-scrum-product-owner-cspo-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO®)</a
		> is an excellent way to grow your knowledge and skills in Agile product development and effectively
		manage product development using the Scrum framework. Scrum is a widely adopted Agile framework that
		promotes iterative and incremental product development, and the Product Owner ensures the team builds
		the right product. The Product Owner does this using learning about Discovery, improving communications
		with the Team, and by validating the result. In addition, the Product Owner collaborates with the
		end users and other stakeholders to ensure that the product continues to evolve to meet their needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		To embark on the journey of becoming a CSPO, you must start by understanding the fundamentals of
		Scrum. Familiarize yourself with the core principles, roles, events, and artifacts of the Scrum
		framework. Scrum is based on values like transparency, inspection, and adaptation, and it
		involves key roles such as the Scrum Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although not a requirement for Scrum Product Owner certification, it helps to have prior work
		experience in Scrum. It will give you insights to the challenges a Product Owner faces in the
		real world. However, our Certified Scrum Product Owner training workshop is designed with the
		assumption that attendees have no experience. Instead, we start work as Product Owners evolving
		a Product from scratch. Even if you have no Scrum experience, the exercises are designed to
		guide you through the process.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next step is to attend our Scrum Alliance qualified Certified Scrum Product Owner training.
		The course is a two-day workshop and, unlike the ScrumMaster workshop, there is no test at the
		end. Instead, certification is on the basis of your participation and understanding in the
		workshop. During the training, you will delve deeper into the Scrum framework, the role of the
		Product Owner, and the skills required to succeed in this role. The course is designed to be
		highly interactive and engaging, incorporating various activities, exercises, discussions, and
		real-life examples to help you understand the practical aspects of the Product Owner&#8217;s
		responsibilities.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the Certified Scrum Product Owner training course, you will learn about various crucial
		aspects, such as creating and managing a Product Backlog, defining a clear product vision,
		collaborating with stakeholders, prioritizing work items, and maximizing the value delivered by
		the Development Team. Mark Levison will share his expertise and guide you through real-world
		scenarios, helping you grasp the intricacies of the Product Owner role.
	</p>
	<p>
		Active participation in the course is key, and required for certification. Engage in
		discussions, ask questions, and collaborate with other participants to gain diverse perspectives
		on different challenges faced in product development. The course offers a platform to share
		experiences and learn from each other, making the learning process fun, and not boring.
	</p>
	<p>
		After completing the <a href="/cspo-certification-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>Certified Scrum Product Owner certification requirements</a
		>, Mark will submit your name to the ScrumAlliance as being eligible for Certified Scrum Product
		Owner certification. You will then receive an email invitation direct from ScrumAlliance to
		activate your Scrum Alliance membership if you don’t already have one, and apply the Certified
		Scrum Product Owner certification.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your CSPO certification is valid for two years from the date of issue. To maintain your
		certification beyond that period, you will need to earn Scrum Education Units (SEUs) and pay a
		renewal fee. SEUs are earned by participating in educational activities related to Agile and
		Scrum. This ensures that CSPOs stay up-to-date with the latest practices and continue to grow
		professionally in their Agile journey. We have a number of ways on our website for you to earn
		your Education Units. You could attend our monthly Lean Coffees and participate in the
		discussion process, you could read one of our many blog posts, or you could download one of
		Mark’s eBooks.
	</p>
	<p>
		The CSPO certification equips you with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to become an
		effective Product Owner. You will have the tools to help deliver products that delight your
		customers. Through the training, certification, and ongoing learning, you become part of the
		Agile community. Along the way you can contribute to the continuous improvement of product
		development practices.
	</p>
	<p>
		Becoming a Certified Scrum Product Owner is a rewarding and valuable achievement for
		professionals involved in product development and Agile practices. If you want to make a
		significant impact on your product&#8217;s success and work collaboratively with your team and
		stakeholders, the path to becoming a Certified Scrum Product Owner might be the right one for
		you.
