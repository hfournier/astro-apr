	<p>
		If you want to achieve new heights in your career, consider earning an <strong
			>Advanced Certified Scrum Master® (A-CSM) certification</strong
		>. This certification demonstrates that you have committed to learning the necessary skills and
		experience to facilitate and coach Scrum Teams through complex challenges.
	</p>
	<p>
		To earn this certification, you’ll need to pursue <a
			href="/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">advanced Scrum Master training</a
		> with an accredited Certified Scrum Trainer. As part of the process, you also need to actively participate
		and demonstrate a deep understanding of the Agile and Scrum principles discussed in the course. The
		duration of Scrum Master Certification is two years, after which you will need to submit to the Scrum
		Alliance® a renewal fee and demonstrate ongoing learning by logging achieved Scrum Education Units
		(SEUs).
	</p>
	<p>
		It’s critical that you take your Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training from an experienced and
		knowledgeable Certified Scrum trainer who helps you have a deep understanding of the Scrum
		master role, and how to practice it effectively, and then supports you after the training as you
		implement what you learned. Your trainer should understand Scrum (all do), Kanban, Lean Software
		Development, Facilitation skills, Product Ownership and have a solid understanding of
		behavioural psychology (most don’t).

	<h2>More About Scrum Masters</h2>
	<p>
		A Scrum Master is an individual who manages multifaceted projects and coaches Scrum teams using
		the Scrum framework. Although Scrum can be used in many industries, it’s commonly adopted by
		technology companies (especially software development companies) to facilitate and manage their
		software development projects more effectively and deliver value frequently and iteratively.
	</p>
	<p>
		To become an Advanced Certified Scrum Master, you must demonstrate a strong understanding of the
		necessary skills and principles in Agile methodology and the Scrum Master framework. These
		skills are acquired through training and experience.
	</p>
	<h2>How Long Does It Take to Become an Advanced Certified Scrum Master?</h2>
	<p>
		There are several prerequisites you must fulfill first before you can qualify for the A-CSM
		certificate.
	</p>
	<p>
		To begin, you must first earn Certified ScrumMaster certification by successfully completing an
		accredited Certified ScrumMaster course with a Certified Scrum trainer (CST). The initial
		Certified ScrumMaster training course requires a minimum of fourteen hours of direct
		instruction, plus any preparation time. It offers an overview of Scrum, preparing you with the
		required knowledge and skills to perform the Scrum Master role.
	</p>
	<p>
		You must successfully complete that Certified ScrumMaster training and pass its certification
		exam. In addition, you need a minimum of one year of experience in the Scrum Master role within
		the last five years before you can qualify for Advanced Certified ScrumMaster certification,
		however that experience can have been acquired before you took your CSM.
	</p>
	<h2>Deepening Your Scrum Master Skills</h2>
	<p>
		Certified ScrumMasters can enroll in Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training to deepen their
		understanding of Scrum and learn new skills on how to coach Scrum teams effectively. Agile Pail
		Relief offers a live online course that is an immersive learning experience, spread over several
		weeks so you have time to actually practice the key Scrum concepts, skills, principles, and
		practical solutions for difficult, real-life scenarios and then apply them the next day, with
		follow-up support as needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Successfully demonstrating a deep understanding of the Scrum Master role and completing the
		Advanced Certified ScrumMaster training will earn you the Advanced Certified ScrumMaster
		certification. Your A-CSM certificate will be valid for a duration of two years with the Scrum
		Alliance, after which you can renew it for another two-year period by paying a renewal fee and
		logging the required Scrum Education Units.
