		Have you considered the choice between <a
			href="/professional-scrum-master-vs-certified-scrum-master"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">professional scrum master vs. certified scrum master</a
		> ? Are you standing on the precipice of a career in project management or looking to bolster your
		credentials with a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification? If so, you&#8217;re likely considering
		the cost of the CSM training and examination process.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Certified Scrum Master program is overseen by the Scrum Alliance and is a globally
		recognized credential in the world.
	</p>
	<p>Let&#8217;s break down the cost of acquiring your Certified Scrum Master certification.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Training Course:</strong><br />
			The first step towards acquiring a Scrum Master certification is attending our Certified ScrumMaster
			training. Throughout the two day workshop, you will learn &#8211; and practice &#8211; all that
			is required for ScrumMaster certification from instructor Mark Levison, one of the oldest Scrum/Agile
			practitioners in Canada (he&#8217;s been practicing since 2001, before Scrum was popular).Our courses
			are unique in their approach, and aren&#8217;t a static class with a bunch of words on PowerPoint
			slides. Each workshop is run using the principles of Scrum, so by the end of it attendees already
			have hands-on, practical experience, and solid ideas of how to go forward thanks to case study
			discussions and examples.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Examination Fee:</strong><br />
			The good news here is that the cost of the initial exam attempt is included in the price of the
			workshop. This means that your first two attempts at the scrum master certification examination
			won&#8217;t incur any additional costs. In over 13 years and more than 8,000 people certified,
			no one has ever written to us to complain that they needed more than two attempts.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Scrum Alliance Membership:</strong><br />
			Two years of Scrum Alliance membership is included when we register you with the ScrumAlliance.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Certification Renewal Fee:</strong><br />
			CSM certification isn&#8217;t a one-time affair; to maintain the certification status, you must
			renew it with the Scrum Alliance every two years, which comes with a $100 fee.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When considering <a
			href="/certified-scrum-master-certification-cost"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">certified scrum master certification cost</a
		>, it’s very important to compare apples to apples, and not to lemons. Discount training will
		get you discount results. Look for a Certified Scrum Trainer who will provide value and support
		to you well after the two day workshop is over. At AgilePainRelief, we are known for going well
		above and beyond the minimum, with added value such as follow-up to help you implement what
		you’ve learned, e-books and other resources to continue your education, and in-person coaching
		to assist when you hit a speed bump (even seasoned scrum masters hit speed bumps).
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that we&#8217;ve explored the cost structure, let&#8217;s shift our focus to the potential
		returns. The value of Scrum Master certification isn&#8217;t merely a quantifiable dollar
		amount; it extends to qualitative aspects that boost your career trajectory.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, the certification equips you with a concrete understanding of Scrum methodology,
		empowering you to navigate product development and project management waters with confidence and
		efficiency.
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondly, the CSM indicates to potential employers your interest in Scrum and commitment to
		continued learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		From a monetary perspective, Scrum Master certification tends to lead to higher pay than those
		who do not yet have the certification or training.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you dive into the CSM certification process, though, remember to factor in indirect
		costs, such as time invested in preparation and possible time off work for training and
		examination.
	</p>
	<p>
		All considered, it&#8217;s essential to remember that while the CSM certification has its costs,
		its value lies not just in the immediate financial return, but also in the long-term career
		benefits it provides. The training equips you with the tools to excel in project management,
		streamline processes, and drive team performance — advantages that can&#8217;t be entirely
		measured in dollars and cents, but contribute significantly to your professional growth.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, if you&#8217;re considering the Scrum Master Certification, weigh the costs against the
		potential benefits. We think you’ll find that the investment is worth the price, not just for
		the monetary return, but also for the personal and professional growth that comes with it.
