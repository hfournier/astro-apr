		Many companies, especially those dealing with software development projects, use the Scrum
		framework for managing activities and roles. If you are a team leader or project manager and
		want to achieve new heights in your career, consider learning more about Agile methodology and
		Scrum practices through Scrum Master certification training.

	<h2>Scrum Alliance Scrum Master Certifications</h2>
	<p>
		Scrum Master certifications play a pivotal role in demonstrating credibility and expertise in
		the world of project management and Agile approaches. The Scrum Alliance is a not-for-profit
		group founded in 2001 and is the original – and most widely recognized &#8211; Scrum certifying
		body. Not all project managers need an <a
			href="/advanced-certified-scrummaster-acsm-training"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">advanced CSM certification</a
		>, but having at least the most basic Scrum Master certification is very beneficial. As a
		project professional, it’s important to determine if you want to become a Certified Scrum Master
		(CSM) and follow the Scrum Master track of Scrum Master certifications available.
	</p>
	<p>Here are the most popular Scrum Master certifications:</p>
	<h3>Certified Scrum Master</h3>
	<p>
		The Certified ScrumMaster ® (CSM®) certification is suitable for Scrum Masters, Project
		Managers (who want to evolve) team leaders and anyone else who wants to understand why their
		organization has added a role with a very strange title. If you hope to lead a cross-functional
		team and manage complex projects, you should consider starting this career path by attending
		training and earning a CSM certification.
	</p>
	<h3>Advanced Certified Scrum Master</h3>
	<p>
		The Advanced Certified Scrum Master® (A-CSM®) certification is more advanced than the basic
		CSM certification. Once you acquire your CSM certificate–which introduces you to the basic Scrum
		practices, ideologies, applications, and values–your next step should be to enroll in A-CSM
		training.
	</p>
	<p>
		An A-CSM course teaches you how to facilitate effective dialogues between your Product Owners,
		members of your Scrum Team, clients, executives, and stakeholders. You’ll also learn how to
		respond effectively to anyone who resists change.
	</p>
	<p>
		When there’s little or no engagement and motivation in your Scrum teams, you’ll know what to do
		to help improve team morale, ensure psychological safety so team members can communicate openly
		and honestly without fear, and encourage conflict resolution and the sense of being a true team
		working collaboratively toward a common goal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The course also teaches you how to promote engagement and a greater sense of accountability,
		obligation, and buy-in. Furthermore, you’ll learn to scale the Scrum framework and Agile
		ideologies beyond one team.
	</p>
	<p>
		The A-CSM course enables you to build on the foundational knowledge of Scrum with improved
		implementation skills. An A-CSM certification will help to distinguish you from other Scrum
		Masters in the global job market.
	</p>
	<p>
		You’ll stand out as a globally recognized Scrum Master and a member of the prestigious Scrum
		community. This certification gives you great value that every potential employer is looking
		for.
	</p>
	<h3>Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Master</h3>
	<p>
		On the Scrum Master track, the Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Master® (CSP-SM®)
		certification is the highest level of accomplishment. Through CSP-SM training, you can challenge
		your team members to enhance how they apply the Scrum framework and Agile methodology for
		increased productivity and better results.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will be a professional Scrum Master with demonstrable experience and proven familiarity with
		Scrum. The CSP-SM course helps you learn how to develop practical solutions to complex
		challenges and enhance your Scrum implementation strategies.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the highest level of Scrum Master certification, the CSP-SM certification allows you to
		prosper as a project manager. With this certification, you’ll not be just a project manager but
		a professional team leader with exceptional project management and facilitation skills.
	</p>
	<p>
		This level of certification also establishes a gateway toward Certified Scrum Trainer® (CST®),
		Certified Enterprise Coach ℠ (CEC℠), or Certified Team Coach ℠ (CTC℠) certifications.
	</p>
	<h2>How to Advance to the Next Level of Scrum Master Certification</h2>
	<p>
		You need a qualified and experienced Certified Scrum Trainer to take you through the different
		courses and prepare you for the relevant certification requirement to attain the highest level
		of Scrum Master certification possible. Before you sign up for training, ensure that your
		trainer has extensive experience and understanding of the material and practices, and isn’t just
		teaching you theory to memorize. The certifications will not be useful to you unless you have
		the skills and knowledge to apply the learning in practical, real-life situations effectively.
		All training at Agile Pain Relief is done by Certified Scrum Trainer and Agile expert Mark
		Levison, who has decades of experience with Scrum.
